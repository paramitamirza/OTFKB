his parents safe haven when they first immigrated to the country,
is now his home."

to New York, which he claims is now “back to normal.” This phrase

alone with a glass of wine. The thought of doing so, however, makes
him feel very old, and he suddenly has the desire to give Sharmila
some advice about life and share some of his wisdom with her. But,
realizing that she wouldn’t be interested, he sends her home instead. Lucien
then begins daydreaming of Charlie, which reminds him of Nathaniel
and Nathaniel’s parents, Isaac and Rose, who’d been Charlie’s sister.
They had asked Lucien and Charlie to look after their son when he’d
first moved to the city, which had irritated him, not because he
disliked Nathaniel but because he felt that Rose and Isaac doted
on the boy too much."

A Border PassageLeila Ahmed,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/borderpassage/summary.html,"Ahmed is soon headed to Cambridge, England, to study literature, a place she
reveres as an intellectual wonderland and the embodiment of all the things she
remembers reading in English books as a child—forests, fog, turrets, and towers.
Here, Ahmed finds a different kind of community of women in teachers like Mrs. Madge
and Miss Bradbrook, and with friends like Veena, an Indian woman who shares some of
Ahmed’s feelings of displacement. At Cambridge, Ahmed experiences a more genteel
form of racism, a feeling of being lumped together with all the people who aren’t
part of the white British establishment, no matter what their race or cultural
background. Between her undergraduate and graduate days, Ahmed returns to Egypt to
find it totally changed. Her father is gravely ill, and she can tell that her mother
had suffered the burden of her father’s illness as well as persecution via Nasser’s
increasingly repressive regime. Upon returning to Cambridge to begin graduate
studies, Ahmed meets Alan, the man she will marry and eventually divorce."
A Border PassageLeila Ahmed,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/borderpassage/summary.html,"Ahmed attends a British school in the suburbs of Cairo and prefers play to
work, though her test scores and voracious appetite for books help her move ahead
quickly in school. Jews and Muslims at the school are excused from the daily
Christian prayers, and that’s how Ahmed meets and befriends Joyce, a Jewish girl in
her grade. Ahmed is encouraged to skip a grade, but her academic ambitions are
tempered by the school’s English headmaster, Mr. Price, who accuses her of
plagiarizing her own well-written essays. Ahmed likewise finds her English teachers
discouraging of her ambitions of pursuing science or mathematics. In school, Ahmed
studies the history, geography, and flora and fauna of Europe, while learning little
about that of her own country. Still, Ahmed isn’t completely insulated from the
politics of her day. She recognizes the growing influence of a group called the
Muslim Brotherhood, which stands in opposition to colonialism and Western influence
in the Middle East."
A Border PassageLeila Ahmed,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/borderpassage/summary.html,"Ahmed’s view of Islam is shaped through the time she spends at her mother’s
childhood home of Zatoun, in Cairo, where Ahmed is surrounded by a rich and engaging
community of women. While listening to her mother, grandmother, and other women
converse, Ahmed learns about Islam as being a generous and pacifistic faith. Though
she receives no direct religious instruction from these women, and her father has
decided not to send her to an Islamic school, Ahmed nonetheless comes to appreciate
the oral, living tradition of Islam, which, in contrast to the rigid, authoritative
Islam that is handed down in texts, encompasses many interpretations. As much as she
recognizes the positive force that this humane form of Islam has manifested in her
family’s life, she also recognizes the powerlessness of her mother and grandmother
in the society they live in. Ahmed’s grandmother, for instance, has for years been
mourning the suicide of her son Fuad, a tragedy she blames on her husband’s
disapproval of Fuad. A similar fate befell Grandmother’s daughter Aida, who
committed suicide after being unable to secure permission for a divorce from an
unhappy marriage through the stern figure of Grandfather. Because of these
tragedies, the estate of Zatoun always seems to have a pall of gloom over it in
young Ahmed’s eyes."
A Border PassageLeila Ahmed,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/borderpassage/summary.html,"During her graduate studies, Ahmed yearns for a place in the academy for the
voices from the margins—blacks, women, and people from the third world. Toward the
end of her graduate student days, Ahmed begins to suffer from a mysterious illness.
After several frustrating visits with different doctors, Ahmed is finally diagnosed
with sarcodosis, a chronic autoimmune disease. Ahmed reads Edward Said’s
Orientalism while trying to sort out her place as an Egyptian
woman in the West. After leaving Cambridge, Ahmed accepts a teaching position in Abu
Dhabi and joins a committee to help reform education throughout the United Arab
Emirates. Recognizing the unique qualities of this “Gulf Arabic” culture helps her
to re-examine the implications of her own “Egyptian Arabic” identity and her place
in the larger Arab world. Ahmed moves to the United States and finds that the
atmosphere in women’s studies departments in the 1980s is not exactly hospitable to
the viewpoints of women from other cultures. However, she does find her new
environment exciting and intellectually stimulating, and even as she endeavors to
make a contribution to her the world of ideas in her new home, she never turns her
back on her Egyptian heritage."
A Border PassageLeila Ahmed,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/borderpassage/summary.html,"Growing up during the last days of the British colonial presence in Egypt,
Leila Ahmed’s childhood is marked by a collision of cultures. Among Syrians,
Lebanese, Palestinians, and other Egyptians from a similar class background in
school, young Ahmed considers it quite normal to grow up speaking English or French
and being called by the anglicized name “Lily” in school. Ahmed lives in Cairo, at
the crossroads of spiritual hubs, ancient sites, and modern sprawl, in a beautiful
house known as Ain Shams. Her father is an esteemed engineer who, as chairman of the
Nile Water Control Board, had run into trouble with the government for opposing
their plan to build the High Dam on ecological grounds. Though her father’s concerns
about the fate of the Nile River will ultimately be born out by the facts, his
opposition to the government’s grand improvement project will haunt him for years to
come. Later, he will be harassed by authorities and have his bank account frozen."
A Border PassageLeila Ahmed,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/borderpassage/summary.html,"As a young child, Ahmed is very attached to Nanny, her Croatian governess.
Nanny is a deeply religious Christian and tells Ahmed stories of angels and the
supernatural. Ahmed has a more conflicted relationship with her mother. Ahmed
aspires to be a professional and views her mother with contempt for not working.
Later, when Ahmed’s father falls ill with chronic pneumonia, Ahmed will come to
value her mother’s dedication more, as well as the strength of the bond between her
parents. One of Ahmed’s closest childhood friends is Gina, a neighbor girl and the
daughter of Italian parents. Gina’s older brother, Freddy, subjects Ahmed to brutal
and sexual games when she is around eight years old, and when Ahmed’s mother finds
out about it, she beats her and takes her to a doctor to be examined. In the
aftermath of this event, Ahmed is forbidden to play outside, even with Gina, and is
subjected to her mother’s disdain, furthering the rift between mother and daughter."

A Clockwork OrangeAnthony Burgess,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/clockworkorange/summary.html,"A Clockwork Orange takes place in a futuristic
city governed by a repressive, totalitarian super-State. In this
society, ordinary citizens have fallen into a passive stupor of
complacency, blind to the insidious growth of a rampant, violent
youth culture. The protagonist of the story is Alex, a fifteen-year-old
boy who narrates in a teenage slang called nadsat,
which incorporates elements of Russian and Cockney English. Alex
leads a small gang of teenage criminals—Dim, Pete, and Georgie—through
the streets, robbing and beating men and raping women. Alex and
his friends spend the rest of their time at the Korova Milkbar,
an establishment that serves milk laced with drugs, and a bar called
the Duke of New York."

prison is difficult for him. The guards are merciless and oppressive,
and several of the other prisoners want to rape him. After a few
years, though, prison life becomes easier. He befriends the prison
chaplain, who notices Alex’s interest in the Bible. The chaplain
lets Alex read in the chapel while listening to classical music,

is selected as the first candidate for an experimental treatment
called Ludovico’s Technique, a form of brainwashing that incorporates associative
learning. After being injected with a substance that makes him dreadfully
sick, the doctors force Alex to watch exceedingly violent movies.
In this way, Alex comes to associate violence with the nausea and
headaches he experiences from the shot. The process takes two weeks
to complete, after which the mere thought of violence has the power
to make Alex ill. As an unintended consequence of the treatment,
Alex can no longer enjoy classical music, which he has always associated

auto theft, breaking and entering, and rape. The last of these crimes
is particularly brutal. The boys travel to the countryside with
their stolen car, break into a cottage and beat up the man inside

to the Korova, where they fight with each other. Alex, who loves
classical music, becomes angry at Dim when Dim mocks an opera that
Alex likes. Alex punches Dim in the face, which prompts the others
to turn against their arrogant leader. The next time they go out,
they break into an old woman’s house. She calls the police, and

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yankee/summary.html,"The Yankee is a product of nineteenth-century America and detests the unfairness inherent in sixth-century institutions of inherited rank and social stratification. He blames the Catholic Church for providing justifications for social inequality, and he wants to destroy the Church's potential for abuse by breaking it into separate sects that people could join at will. The Yankee is an idealist and believes firmly in the power of technology to improve people's lives and bring about positive social change. In the end, though, as R. L. Fisher observes, the book loses its idealistic tone, and the promise of technology falls short of the Yankee's lofty goals: ""For while it mocks the British monarchy, it also makes a mockery of Hank Morgan's hope that technology might further the moral improvement of humanity."""

The service is short and sweet, and many more people come out than Robert has expected or invited. They bury Haven in the family plot near the apple orchard, and then they go their separate ways. In the time before and after the service, Robert finds random chores to keep him busy and keep his mind off of what had happened. In the tackroom, he finds a piece of paper and pencil, where his father had been trying to learn how to write his name. Near the end of the page, he had almost got the hang of it."

They watch an eagle hunt and kill a rabbit and take in the beauty of the sunset. Later that night while Robert is sleeping, he is awakened by the sound of rain and voices downstairs. Eavesdropping, he learns that Mrs. Hillman has come over in some distress over her husband. Haven then comes in from outside and calls up to Robert to get dressed and yoke up Samson to the wagon. He does this without a word, and then he and Haven, armed with shotgun and lantern, head toward Learning. Reaching town, they go to the churchyard and discover Mr. Hillman digging up a grave. He is digging up the baby of a love affair that he had once had with one of Mr. Peck's kin so that he can expose his sin to the rest of the world. When Haven sees that Hillman does not plan on desecrating the grave of his kin, he helps Mr. Hillman finish. With the coffin in tow, they all head back to the Peck place for breakfast."

Haven drops Robert off at the Tanners' place, asking him to remember his manners. The Tanners and Robert arrive at Rutland in no time, thanks to the power of Mr. Tanner's twin horses. They head for the stalls where the livestock is kept. The cattle showing is first, so they yoke up Bib and Bob, the calves that Robert assisted in birth, and head for the ring. When their names are called, Robert walks the oxen around the ring three times to the cheers of the crowd. When the show is over, Mrs. Tanner runs up and tells Robert that the children's pig judging will be happening in any minute. She minds the oxen while Robert and Mr. Tanner hurry back to get Pinky. After washing her down, they race over to the judging area, and they get there just in time. Pinky wins a ribbon for being the best-behaved pig at the fair, but Robert doesn't find out until later—when the judge comes over, Robert throws up all over his shoes."

Benjamin thanks Robert and gives Robert a baby pig for his trouble. Robert immediately names the pig Pinky, and the two become best friends. Robert soon learns that owning a pig is not easy, as Haven explains that they will have to build Pinky a home away from the other animals. After dinner, they discover an old corn cratch near the barn, which would make a nice house. To make sure that Pinky will not bother the other animals, Robert and Haven set up a capstan, which their ox, Samson, uses to move the cratch to a suitable location."

As the only one among them who can read, Matty is shocked by the 'D' that Robert has gotten in English, even though he got 'A's in every other subject. She decides on the spot that she is going to tutor Robert and drags him into the parlor for a first lesson. Aunt Matty immediately determines the problem and tries to teach Robert how to diagram sentences. When he cannot, Matty simply does it all for him.

ground and manpower daily. Soon after Henry’s arrival, a bombardment begins.
When word comes that German troops are breaking through the Italian
lines, the Allied forces prepare to retreat. Henry leads his team
of ambulance drivers into the great column of evacuating troops.
The men pick up two engineering sergeants and two frightened young
girls on their way. Henry and his drivers then decide to leave the
column and take secondary roads, which they assume will be faster.
When one of their vehicles bogs down in the mud, Henry orders the
two engineers to help in the effort to free the vehicle. When they
refuse, he shoots one of them. The drivers continue in the other
trucks until they get stuck again. They send off the young girls
and continue on foot toward Udine. As they march, one of the drivers
is shot dead by the easily frightened rear guard of the Italian
army. Another driver marches off to surrender himself, while Henry
and the remaining driver seek refuge at a farmhouse. When they rejoin
the retreat the following day, chaos has broken out: soldiers, angered
by the Italian defeat, pull commanding officers from the melee and
execute them on sight. The battle police seize Henry, who, at a

three weeks convalescence leave, after which he is scheduled to
return to the front. He tries to plan a trip with Catherine, who
reveals to him that she is pregnant. The following day, Henry is
diagnosed with jaundice, and Miss Van Campen, the superintendent
of the hospital, accuses him of bringing the disease on himself
through excessive drinking. Believing Henry’s illness to be an attempt
to avoid his duty as a serviceman, Miss Van Campen has Henry’s leave
revoked, and he is sent to the front once the jaundice has cleared.

town called Montreux and agree to put the war behind them forever.

men on the front, the two succeed in living a beautiful, peaceful
life. When spring arrives, the couple moves to Lausanne so that
they can be closer to the hospital. Early one morning, Catherine
goes into labor. The delivery is exceptionally painful and complicated.
Catherine delivers a stillborn baby boy and, later that night, dies

Historically, Fix led many lynch mobs against the local blacks. Everyone at the plantation believes that he will soon arrive once again to seek revenge, especially since the murdered man, Beau, is his son. Before anything else happens though, two other men arrive: Lou Dimes, Candy's boyfriend, and Sheriff Mapes. After the Sheriff sees Beau's dead body, he instructs his deputy to find Fix and keep him off the plantation as to avoid a lynching.

Candy believes that Mathu killed Beau, but as Mathu is virtually her foster father she wants to make every effort to protect him. Candy immediately gathers everyone in the plantation to Mathu's house. When Miss Merle, the mistress of a local plantation arrives, Candy promptly confesses to the murder. Miss Merle does not believe her, but agrees to help. Candy decides that the best course of action would be to bring all the local men to Mathu's house with as many twelve gauge shotguns and empty shells as possible. With numerous men and guns at the crime scene, Candy believes that the local Sheriff will not be able to solve the crime. Miss Merle spreads Candy's plan through the community. Within a few hours, eighteen men have gathered at Mathu's house. All of these men are in their seventies and their eighties, but they have all brought their shotguns and are ready to confess."

A Hunger ArtistFranz Kafka,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-hunger-artist/summary.html,"Although the hunger artist is famous, he is perpetually unhappy. Because of the townspeople’s incredulity, the hunger artist realizes that only he can be truly satisfied with his feats of self-denial. The hunger artist also feels constrained by the fasting limits imposed on him. Although the hunger artist finds fasting easy and can go much longer than forty days, the impresario always cuts the performance short because the spectators tend to lose interest. Furthermore, the ritual in which the impresario forces the hunger artist to break the fast is humiliating and unpleasant. First, doctors enter the cage to report the hunger artist’s condition, which is announced with a megaphone. Next, two ladies chosen from the crowd try to help the hunger artist out of his cage. Unfailingly, the hunger artist objects, and the impresario intrudes to make a show of how frail the hunger artist has become. By the time the ritual is over, the hunger artist has been force-fed and the crowd moved by the hunger artist’s seemingly desperate condition. In truth, however, the hunger artist is miserable only because he knows he could have fasted longer and that his supposed fans actually hate him."
A Hunger ArtistFranz Kafka,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-hunger-artist/summary.html,"The hunger artist goes on living in fame and quiet dissatisfaction, becoming hostile only when the occasional person theorizes that the root of his melancholy might be the fasting itself. At this suggestion, the hunger artist rattles his cage like a beast and can be calmed only by the impresario, who plays up the hunger artist’s misery to the people by showing photographs of him withering away. Though these photos in reality capture the hunger artist looking wretched because he is being forced from the cage against his will, the impresario advertises it all as the effect of the fasting itself. The impresario’s gesture never fails to cow the hunger artist, who sinks in submission, back into his straw, forever misunderstood."
A Hunger ArtistFranz Kafka,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-hunger-artist/summary.html,"Many days pass before a circus overseer notices what seems to be an unused cage. Upon closer inspection, the overseer discovers the hunger artist buried in the straw, near death. Thinking the hunger artist insane, the overseer humors the hunger artist in his last words. The hunger artist asks to be forgiven, explaining that he has wanted only to be admired by everyone. When the overseer assures him that everyone does admire him, the hunger artist tells the overseer that they shouldn’t, confessing that he has fasted only because in life he could not find food that he liked. With these words, the hunger artist dies. The circus attendants bury him with his straw and restock the cage with a young panther, which is unlike the hunger artist in nearly every way. Stalking about in its cage, the panther brims with life, feeding hungrily and expressing freedom and vitality. In no time, it becomes a major draw for the circus, and crowds of people edge close to the cage in breathless excitement."
A Hunger ArtistFranz Kafka,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-hunger-artist/summary.html,"A man who is known only as “the hunger artist” and fasts for a living travels from town to European town with the impresario (his manager). In each town, the hunger artist chooses a public location and puts himself on display in a locked, straw-lined cage, where he fasts for periods of up to forty days. In the hunger artist’s heyday, people from all over the surrounding area come to witness his performances. Children especially are drawn to him, and when the hunger artist is not hypnotically withdrawn in the cage, he talks to them and answers their questions with a smile. The adults also avidly monitor the hunger artist’s progress, but they generally do so out of suspicion that the hunger artist is sneaking food. To the hunger artist’s frustration, the townspeople assign men, usually butchers, to ensure that the hunger artist does not eat during the night. Even more annoying to the hunger artist, however, is that these men deliberately turn a blind eye to the hunger artist as if to allow him to steal a bite of food. The hunger artist sings to prove that he is not eating, but the people think he has simply mastered the art of eating and singing simultaneously."
A Hunger ArtistFranz Kafka,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-hunger-artist/summary.html,"Professional fasting eventually goes into decline, as audiences develop a taste for newer, more exciting forms of entertainment. The hunger artist and impresario dissolve their partnership, but because the hunger artist is too old to take up a new profession, he attempts to ride out the trend against fasting in the hope that it reverses itself. He joins a circus and becomes a sideshow, placed at the entrance of the menagerie of animals and other curiosities. As a result of his placement, the hunger artist is ignored by the throngs of people who have come for the livelier attractions inside. The hunger artist is nonexistent, save for a few stragglers who look at him as an anachronism. Left alone, the hunger artist finally exceeds his fasting record, although there is no way to tell exactly how long he has fasted because the circus attendants forget to change the sign on which his daily total appears. The hunger artist wastes away in his cage, unnoticed and unappreciated."

a plantation outside Bayonne, Louisiana, for several years
when a slow-witted man named Jefferson is convicted of murder and
sentenced to death. Jefferson claims he is innocent of the crime.
He says he was on his way to a bar, but changed his mind and decided
to tag along with two men who were on their way to a liquor store. Upon
arriving there, the two men began arguing with the storeowner, and
a shootout ensued. The storeowner and the two men died, and Jefferson
remained at the scene of the crime. He was arrested and tried for
murder. Jefferson’s lawyer argues in court that Jefferson is nothing
but a poor fool, hardly more worthwhile than a hog, and therefore
incapable of plotting such a scheme. The jury quickly brings back
a guilty verdict."

man. He deplores the injustices done to his fellow black men, but
he does not want to get involved in Jefferson’s case. However, after
considerable pressure from his aunt, Tante Lou, he agrees to try
to help Jefferson. Grant, Miss Emma, and Grant’s aunt go to visit
Jefferson in his cell, and they discover that he too heard the lawyer’s
words and has taken them to heart. Silent and moody, Jefferson resists

in his journal. In March, the governor of Louisiana sets the execution
date for two weeks after Easter. As news of Jefferson’s impending
death spreads through the town, more and more people begin to visit
him. Young children and old men, strangers and friends, all come
to -Jefferson’s cell to speak to him. The onslaught of attention
makes Jefferson begin to understand the enormity of the task that
Grant has given him. He realizes that he has become much more than

with Jefferson about his final meal. Jefferson admits that he wants
a gallon of vanilla ice cream because, although he loves ice cream,
he has never had more than a thimbleful at a time. This admission
begins to break down the barrier between the two men. Grant borrows
money from some townspeople and buys Jefferson a small
radio. On his next visit, he brings Jefferson a notebook and asks him

the importance of Jefferson’s death. Jefferson asks Grant if he
believes in heaven and Grant replies that he does not, although
he qualifies this remark by saying that his atheism does not make
him a good man. In fact, Grant says, Jefferson will save even Grant’s
atheistic soul if he carries the cross for the sinners on earth.
Grant explains that the black community in the quarter has spent
centuries enslaved to white men, and that when Jefferson’s attorney
called him a hog, he attacked the will and intelligence of the entire
black society. In consequence, Jefferson now has the opportunity
to stand up for his community. He has become a symbol to his people,
and the manner in which he faces his death will bear on their self--confidence
and potential."

England, More reviews the letter to Rome that requests the pope’s
approval of Henry’s divorce. More points out that the pope provided
a dispensation, or exemption, in order for Henry to get married

the widow of Henry’s brother. More doubts that the pope will agree
to overturn his first dispensation. Wolsey accuses More of being
too moralistic and recommends that he be more practical."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Cecilia remained close with her family into adulthood, but as her brothers and
sisters married and moved away, the nature of family changed for her. When Cecilia’s
sisters Christina and Agnes married, they effectively joined their husbands’
families, transferring all of their landholdings and assets to them. At this point,
Cecilia relied more heavily on her brothers Robert and William, who remained nearby
and had power in the community. In 1319, Cecilia’s brother, William, who had left
Brigstock for a time and returned as an educated, low-ranking member of the clergy,
bought a house next door to her. Toward the end of Cecilia’s life, she combined her
resources and household with those of her brother Robert."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Cecilia’s economic livelihood required her to be flexible, innovative, and
accommodating. This economy, called an “economy of makeshifts,” consisted of three
main markets: the labor market, the commodity market, and the land market. With
landholdings so large, Cecilia employed skilled and unskilled laborers and servants
on daily basis. The labor force in Cecilia’s day was made up of local men and
vagrants, wealthy and indigent, landholding and landless. Closely connected to the
labor market was the land market. Land was a source of wealth for landless peasants,
who often worked it for money and food. It was also a great source of wealth for
Cecilia, who could profit from subletting and selling what she produced. Cecilia
excelled in the land market by concentrating on buying pastures for animals to
graze, which limited the number of people she would need to hire. Finally, the
commodity market took place in villages, where people from the surrounding area
would sell and buy everything ranging from food, cloth, and animals to tools,
leather, and smith work. These simple exchanges fed more complex regional and
international markets, which helped lead to regional specialization."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"The Saint Peter and Saint Andrew churches at the center of Stanion and
Brigstock were the focal point of Cecilia’s life. The only real communal structures
in Brigstock, they were central meeting places for markets, ball games, gambling,
gossip, and manorial court meetings. As the centers for spiritual worship, they held
masses nearly every day and were especially popular on Sundays. Like virtually every
other English peasant, Cecilia was a devout Christian who, unable to read, learned
about Catholicism mostly from pictures and the local clergy. Cecilia and her
neighbors also engaged in folk practices, such as spell-casting, and believed in
fairies. The Church generally condoned this behavior and in some ways even
incorporated these folk rituals into religious life, sharing holy days with some
pagan gods. In this sense, Christianity for Cecilia was an extension of everyday
life and responded to the rhythms of the natural world around her. Holy days often
coincided with equinoxes, solstices, and times of harvest."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Manorialism, or feudalism, is the system of estates in which the elite who
owned land profited from peasants, who worked in the fields and paid taxes to their
landlords. Brigstock was a royal manor, which was unusually fortunate for a
landholding tenant such as Cecilia. Whereas peasants on other manors might have had
to deal with vigilant landlords, Cecilia enjoyed some independence from manorial
rule because her landlords were absent. Additionally, as a tenant of Brigstock,
Cecilia benefited from special legal status: she and other tenants could lease the
manor and manage its affairs as they saw fit. Though they paid dearly for this
privilege, in addition to paying yearly taxes and doing work for the landowner
during each year’s harvest, Brigstock peasants achieved dignity and freedom through
self-government."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"A Medieval Life contains ten chapters in which Bennett tells
Cecilia’s story and paints a thorough picture of the world around her. Bennett
organizes these chapters topically rather than chronologically, illuminating in each
one an aspect of medieval society and describing how Cecilia behaved (or might have
behaved) in each context. After an introductory chapter in which she gives a short
overview of medieval England, Bennett uses three chapters to explore the central
institutions of Cecilia’s life: the village and surrounding pastoral community of
her native home; the manor under whose lord’s authority she lived; and the church
that tended her spiritual existence. Bennett then discusses the Great Famine of
1315–1322, a time of transition for both Cecilia and England. In Chapters Six
through Nine, Bennett further delves into the various facets of Cecilia’s life: her
relationship with her family; how she fit into the medieval economy; her rapport
with others in the community; and how her gender affected her experiences. Bennett’s
final chapter examines the implications of Cecilia’s life in relation to the
medieval world and the modern one."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"In Cecilia’s day, community was powerful. Land and farming decisions were made
as a group, all were responsible for the local parish’s upkeep, and as manorial
tenants, people were expected to work together to raise money for the landlords who
required taxes and rent. Though there were king’s courts for serious crimes, people
often handled their own affairs by taking responsibility for each other. Heads of
the household answered for their dependents, and all men were required to join
tithings by the age of twelve. In addition to tithings, there were also officials
who enforced the law and managed the manor’s day-to-day affairs. The men who served
as officials were generally wealthy peasants or minor gentry whose positions gave
them power. Several Penifader men were officials, and though Cecilia profited, she
couldn’t heedlessly flaunt her wealth. Cecilia sat atop a socioeconomically diverse
peasant class, but acting humbly and equitably allowed her to avoid resentment from
neighbors and laborers."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Surrounding Cecilia’s home was a large and diverse community. There were two
main villages in Brigstock manor, Brigstock and Stanion, where many people built
their houses right next to each other, sometimes sharing a wall. Most business and
trade occurred in the villages, but the most important economic activity took place
in the countryside. The Brigstock economy relied heavily upon two types of land:
arable fields, which comprised a quarter of the manor’s lands and were used to grow
wheat, barley, rye, and oats; and meadows and pastures, which existed mainly for the
sheep, horses, and oxen kept by farmers and villagers. Brigstockers used the
three-field system, in which peasants rotated crops among three fields each year.
When Cecilia left her own premises, she could have walked among a few lanes of
tightly bunched homes and outbuildings, then out to surrounding arable fields and
meadows, and beyond that, to Rockingham Forest, which the king used as a hunting
preserve. Many peasants would leave Brigstock to travel to the nearby markets in
Geddington, Kettering, and Corby. Here, peasants got their news about goings-on in
the wider world."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Cecilia matured during a great famine that ravaged England and northern Europe
from 1315 to 1322. Brought on by exceptionally cold, wet weather, and exacerbated by
overpopulation, the famine killed approximately one-tenth of England’s six million
people. To survive, peasants, including Cecilia, resorted to crime. Even as famine
tapered off, crime rates remained inflated, as peasants felt either lingering
resentment toward wealthier neighbors or were simply accustomed to taking a little
more to assuage their worries over an uncertain future. Cecilia’s parents’ deaths
during this time signaled the end of a relatively untroubled childhood. But in some
ways, the Great Famine worked to her benefit. Cecilia’s parents left her a sizeable
inheritance, which she used to embark on a highly profitable career in landholding.
Exploiting the desperate circumstances that led some peasants to sell their land
leases at reduced prices, Cecilia made acquisitions at least six different times
between 1319 and 1325, emerging from the famine with nearly twenty-five acres in her
name."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Cecilia died in late May or early June of 1344. Her will dictated that her
property be divided into thirds and that William’s illegitimate son, John, Agnes’s
daughter, Matilda, and Robert Malin, a man about whom little is known, each be given
a twenty-four–year lease on them. This decision led to bitter argument in the family
because it effectively barred Cecilia’s closest heirs from inheriting the property.
Cecilia’s sister Christina and nephew Martin, the son of her brother Henry,
challenged her will in court and were able to convince a jury to overturn it.
Christina and Martin then battled for sole rights to Cecilia’s landholdings. After a
long and contentious debate, the jury awarded Cecilia’s legacy to Christina, who
promptly transferred half of all of the properties to Martin, an act that suggests
that Christina and Martin negotiated a deal outside of court. No one knows the drama
behind Cecilia’s inheritance, only that her death probably made a number of her kin
unhappy with her."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Cecilia’s world was one in which there were clear-cut distinctions between
men’s and women’s roles in society. As a woman, Cecilia was forbidden to hold any
office or act in any official manner. Literacy, education, and lucrative trade work,
such as blacksmithing or thatching, were unavailable to her. Though women were
exclusively responsible for brewing ales, Cecilia could not hold the office of
aletaster. And because she could not participate in tithings, she was technically
left outside community law. These restrictions left Cecilia at a substantial social
disadvantage because the ability to serve in court and perform more active functions
on the manor made an individual powerful in the community. Cecilia’s disadvantages
also extended to the realm of criminal justice. The Brigstock court records indicate
that men were responsible for eighty percent of violent crimes, but surprisingly few
of these crimes were against women, a phenomenon that suggests that the law did not
protect women as readily as it did men and property."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Cecilia Penifader was born to Robert and Alice Penifader in the late
thirteenth century in Brigstock, a manor in central England. She was the seventh of
eight children, only two of whom died before reaching adulthood, an unusually high
birthrate for the time. Relative to other peasants, Cecilia’s family was wealthy.
Their large house, built of rubble, twigs, mud, and moss, covered about 450 square
feet. It had only one room, at the center of which was a fire for warmth and
cooking. Cecilia probably spent most of her childhood in the farmyard around the
house, playing and, later, helping out with gardening, cooking, and watching her
little sister, Agnes."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"From a young age, Cecilia had a good sense of nuclear family. Her own family
was twice the average size, and every day, they slept, worked, and ate together. As
head of the household, Cecilia’s father, Robert, was the public face of his family
until his sons became old enough to join tithings (groups of men responsible for one
another’s behavior and for law enforcement) and the girls married and moved away.
Robert had to account publicly for Cecilia when a neighbor accused her of stealing
hay from him in 1316. Robert was also responsible for beating his children and
having them perform hard labor in the fields and around the house, practices that
were quite common in the Middle Ages. Robert and Alice seemed to be exceptionally
caring parents, given their efforts to provide some form of inheritance for all of
their children, which was uncommon practice in medieval England."
A Medieval LifeJudith Bennett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medievallife/summary.html,"Cecilia’s world was divided into three interdependent orders: the clergy, the
landed elite, and the peasantry. Cecilia would have considered the clergy most
important because it addressed her chief concern: her eternal salvation. The second
most important was the landed elite—the kings and noblemen who protected the
peasants from foreign invaders. Last was Cecilia’s class, the peasants, who
sustained the country through work. Though in theory each of these orders benefited
equally from the other two, the peasantry was clearly the lowliest order, and all
peasants had to defer to their social superiors in all matters, whether it meant
obeying capricious and unfair laws, bowing one’s head in a lord’s presence, or
performing special work on request."
A Midwife’s TaleLaurel Thatcher Ulrich,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midwifestale/summary.html,"In November of 1792, Martha’s niece, Parthenia Barton, who had been living
with the family for some time, marries Shubael Pitts. Martha’s daughter Hannah
marries Moses Pollard, the son of an old friend, Merriam Pollard, who often worked
as a town nurse. Ulrich then describes traditional marriage practices in those days,
including simple, work-intensive weddings and the fact that couples lived apart
until they were able to set up a household. Martha also talks about being summoned
to Sally Pierce’s delivery. Sally identified Martha’s son Jonathan as the father of
her illegitimate baby and sued him for support, which he fulfilled by marrying her.
Ulrich then discusses the histories and results of other paternity suits from that
time period. In November and December of 1793, Martha describes several
complication-free deliveries she performs in the quiet period following the
weddings. Ulrich expands upon this by explaining in more detail how these deliveries
might have gone and comparing Martha’s success rate to other historical rates."
A Midwife’s TaleLaurel Thatcher Ulrich,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midwifestale/summary.html,"Martha’s youngest daughter, Dolly, marries Barnabas Lambard in May of 1795,
and in Martha’s entries for January of the following year, the problem of housework
has become dramatically larger now that she has no one at home to help her with it.
In November of that year, Martha recounts that a band of armed men had attacked her
husband while he attempted to complete a survey job. Ulrich adds further
explanation, saying that poor settlers often saw surveyors as agents of richer men
who were trying to take away the land that the settlers felt they had won for
themselves. Even in these more difficult times, Martha’s medical involvement in the
community still continues, and in February of 1801, Martha talks about tending to
the death of her daughter-in-law’s nephew and being asked by the doctor to be an
attendant at his dissection. Ulrich follows this with a more detailed look at the
little boy’s history and offers a look at the changing relationship between doctors
and midwives."
A Midwife’s TaleLaurel Thatcher Ulrich,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midwifestale/summary.html,"By March of 1804, Martha had grown weary, troubled by untrustworthy hired
help, Jonathan’s often alcohol-induced temper, and Ephraim’s imprisonment for debt
related to his job as a tax collector. Ulrich gives a more detailed picture of what
Ephraim’s imprisonment would have been like, after which Martha describes the
difficulties of being a woman on her own. Jonathan and his family move in with her,
but due to her strained relationship with Jonathan, and Sally’s insistence on being
mistress of the house, the move only adds to Martha’s troubles. In 1806, however,
Martha’s neighborhood faces even greater obstacles when they discover that a
neighbor, Captain Purrinton, had slaughtered almost his entire family before
committing suicide. Ulrich describes the entirety of the case and gives a few
theories offered at the time as to Captain Purrinton’s motives. Eight months later,
another tragedy hits Martha’s family when the husband of her niece, Betsy Barton,
commits suicide."
A Midwife’s TaleLaurel Thatcher Ulrich,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midwifestale/summary.html,"Ulrich begins each chapter by transcribing a few entries from Martha’s diary,
from the month and year listed in the chapter title. Ulrich follows these entries
with an essay that further explains the entries’ details and relates the entries to
what happened to Martha in the surrounding few years. Ulrich explains and builds on
the entries with her own analysis, and she provides a wider historical context by
drawing from documents such as town records and the diaries of Martha’s New England
contemporaries."
A Midwife’s TaleLaurel Thatcher Ulrich,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midwifestale/summary.html,"Martha Moore was born in 1735 in the small town of Oxford, Massachusetts, to a
well-educated family. She married Ephraim Ballard in 1754 and had her first child,
Cyrus, two years later. She quickly had five more children—four daughters and one
more son—but lost three of the girls to a diphtheria epidemic in 1769. That same
year, she gave birth to her fifth daughter, and her sixth followed two years later.
In 1773, Ephraim traveled to Maine to find a new home for the family, finally
settling in Hallowell and taking management of the mill and property owned by a
British sympathizer who had fled to Canada. Martha and the children joined Ephraim
there in October of 1777, and Martha officially delivered her first child as a
midwife in July of 1778. Martha’s oldest daughter, Lucy, married her cousin Ephraim
Towne that same year, and in 1799, Martha gave birth to her youngest son. She begins
writing in her diary on January 1, 1785."
A Midwife’s TaleLaurel Thatcher Ulrich,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midwifestale/summary.html,"In August of 1787, Martha describes several events that give an overview of
the many medically related tasks she is called on to perform, including delivering
babies, answering false alarms, preparing bodies for burial, making medical calls,
dispensing pills, and harvesting and preparing healing herbs. Ulrich then
gives an overview of homeopathic remedies of the time and the relationship
between local healers and physicians. In September of 1788, Martha talks about
the goods she and her daughters trade with local women and the help
her daughters give her with the housework, particularly the weaving. Ulrich then
discusses the gender-based division of duties, the female economic subsystem of the
time period, and the importance of household help in a midwife’s career. In October
of the following year, Martha’s family is forced to relocate when the mill’s
original owner returns, and she discusses the difficulties of living so much closer
to her neighbors. She also talks about being questioned when one of these new
neighbors accuses a public official of rape. Ulrich offers a fuller historical
account of the case and its participants."
A Midwife’s TaleLaurel Thatcher Ulrich,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midwifestale/summary.html,"By May of 1809, Martha’s focus is mainly on her garden, the preparation that
went into it, and what happened to the produce that came from it. Grandchildren are
now old enough to help her with the housework, and the number of deliveries she
attends has increased dramatically. Ulrich offers details on gardens of the time
period but also describes the larger political turmoil of the area that is only
offered in brief, family-related details in Martha’s diary. Martha attends several
deliveries early in 1812, but the stress makes her ill, and her last entry describes
the family and preacher gathering at her house on May 7. She dies a few weeks later.
The diary is passed down through Dolly’s descendents until it reaches Martha’s
great-great-granddaughter, Mary Hobart, one of the country’s early female
physicians. Mary treasures the diary but gives it to the Maine State Library in
1930 so that it might be more accessible to historians."

A Modest ProposalJonathan Swift,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/modestproposal/summary.html,"The author argues, by hard-edged economic reasoning as well as from a self-righteous moral stance, for a way to turn this problem into its own solution. His proposal, in effect, is to fatten up these undernourished children and feed them to Ireland's rich land-owners. Children of the poor could be sold into a meat market at the age of one, he argues, thus combating overpopulation and unemployment, sparing families the expense of child-bearing while providing them with a little extra income, improving the culinary experience of the wealthy, and contributing to the overall economic well-being of the nation."
A Modest ProposalJonathan Swift,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/modestproposal/summary.html,"The author offers statistical support for his assertions and gives specific data about the number of children to be sold, their weight and price, and the projected consumption patterns. He suggests some recipes for preparing this delicious new meat, and he feels sure that innovative cooks will be quick to generate more. He also anticipates that the practice of selling and eating children will have positive effects on family morality: husbands will treat their wives with more respect, and parents will value their children in ways hitherto unknown. His conclusion is that the implementation of this project will do more to solve Ireland's complex social, political, and economic problems than any other measure that has been proposed."

in the cave. Aziz is set free, and Fielding escorts Adela to the
Government College, where she spends the next several weeks. Fielding
begins to respect Adela, recognizing her bravery in standing against
her peers to pronounce Aziz innocent. Ronny breaks off his engagement

Mrs. Carpenter then sends Sybil away so that she can go have cocktails. Sybil wanders far from the part of the beach where the hotel guests are situated. Eventually, she finds Seymour, who knows her. He tells her he likes her blue bathing suit, but her suit is yellow. Sybil accuses him of letting another little girl, Sharon Lipschutz, sit on the bench with him while he played the piano. Seymour assures Sybil that she is his favorite. Sybil tells Seymour he should push Sharon off the piano bench next time. As they get ready to go into the ocean, Seymour tells Sybil they should look for bananafish. They then discuss the tigers in one of Sybil’s children’s books, Black Sambo, as well as Sybil’s fondness for olives and wax. Sybil asks Seymour whether he likes Sharon Lipschutz, and Seymour tells her that he does, especially the fact that she is nice to small dogs and always kind."

When the call does go through, Muriel reassures her anxious mother about her safety. Her mother is concerned about the erratic, reckless behavior of Seymour, Muriel’s husband. She hints at a car accident that Seymour and Muriel were involved in and suggests that Seymour deliberately crashed Muriel’s father’s car into a tree. She reminds Muriel of the strange and rude things Seymour has said to members of Muriel’s family. Seymour has recently returned from the war, and Muriel’s mother believes that he was discharged from the military hospital prematurely. Muriel is not as concerned as her mother. She is preoccupied by the fashion at the resort and the evening’s events. In the evenings, there are formal dinners and cocktail parties, at which Seymour often sits apart, playing the piano. The resort is full of society people, although Muriel feels that the quality of these people has diminished since the war. She tells her mother that Seymour is on the beach by himself."

In a series of conversations with his companions, Stephen works to formulate his theories about art. While he is dependent on his friends as listeners, he is also determined to create an independent existence, liberated from the expectations of friends and family. He becomes more and more determined to free himself from all limiting pressures, and eventually decides to leave Ireland to escape them. Like his namesake, the mythical Daedalus, Stephen hopes to build himself wings on which he can fly above all obstacles and achieve a life as an artist."
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young ManJames Joyce,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/portraitartist/summary.html,"Stephen begins attending Mass every day, becoming a model of Catholic piety, abstinence, and self-denial. His religious devotion is so pronounced that the director of his school asks him to consider entering the priesthood. After briefly considering the offer, Stephen realizes that the austerity of the priestly life is utterly incompatible with his love for sensual beauty. That day, Stephen learns from his sister that the family will be moving, once again for financial reasons. Anxiously awaiting news about his acceptance to the university, Stephen goes for a walk on the beach, where he observes a young girl wading in the tide. He is struck by her beauty, and realizes, in a moment of epiphany, that the love and desire of beauty should not be a source of shame.

As a young boy, Stephen's Catholic faith and Irish nationality heavily influence him. He attends a strict religious boarding school called Clongowes Wood College. At first, Stephen is lonely and homesick at the school, but as time passes he finds his place among the other boys. He enjoys his visits home, even though family tensions run high after the death of the Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell.

Stephen starts attending a prestigious day school called Belvedere, where he grows to excel as a writer and as an actor in the student theater. His first sexual experience, with a young Dublin prostitute, unleashes a storm of guilt and shame in Stephen, as he tries to reconcile his physical desires with the stern Catholic morality of his surroundings. For a while, he ignores his religious upbringing, throwing himself with debauched abandon into a variety of sins—masturbation, gluttony, and more visits to prostitutes, among others. Then, on a three-day religious retreat, Stephen hears a trio of fiery sermons about sin, judgment, and hell.

A Prayer for Owen MeanyJohn Irving,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/owenmeany/summary.html,"Writing from his home in Toronto, Canada in 1987, John Wheelwright narrates the story of his childhood. Peppering his narrative with frequent diary entries in which he chronicles his outrage against the behavior of the Ronald Reagan administration in the late 1980s, Wheelright tells the story of his early life in Gravesend, New Hampshire, when his best friend was Owen Meany, who he remembers as the boy who accidentally killed Wheelwright's mother and made Wheelright believe in God. The narrative of A Prayer for Owen Meany does not follow a perfect chronology, as John pieces together the story he wants to tell."
A Prayer for Owen MeanyJohn Irving,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/owenmeany/summary.html,"PARGRAPH When the boys are old enough, they enter Gravesend Academy, where Owen thrives: he has a powerful column called ""THE VOICE"" in the school paper, and easily becomes the class valedictorian. Shortly before graduation, however, he is expelled for helping students make fake IDs out of their draft cards--it is the early 1960s, and the Vietnam War is just beginning. After his expulsion, Owen removes a statue of Mary Magdalene from its place in front of a local Catholic school, amputates its arms and head, and welds it to the stage in the Gravesend Academy auditorium. The school minister, the doubt-plagued Rev. Louis Merrill, asks the boys at morning meeting to pray for Owen Meany, and the unpleasant headmaster who expelled Owen loses his job as a result of the event."
A Prayer for Owen MeanyJohn Irving,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/owenmeany/summary.html,"From his house in Toronto, John remembers that also before the funeral, he paid a visit to the Meanys, where Mr. Meany reveals a shocking fact: he claims that Owen was a virgin birth, just like Jesus Christ. He tells John that he told Owen this when Owen was about eleven--about the same time that Owen accidentally killed John's mother. John considers this revelation monstrous, and says that it cannot be true. It remains unclear what John believes about Owen's parentage, however, and the mystery is never explained."
A Prayer for Owen MeanyJohn Irving,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/owenmeany/summary.html,"John and Owen remain close friends. In December, 1953, six months after John's mother's death, John begins to realize just how remarkable Owen is. Simultaneously, Owen wins the role of the Baby Jesus in the Episcopalian Christmas pageant and the role of the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come in an amateur theatrical production of A Christmas Carol. Owen brings the Christmas pageant to a halt when he accosts his parents in the middle of the performance, demanding that they leave. He is chillingly good as the scary ghost in A Christmas Carol, but on the night of the final performance, he has a vision in which he believes he sees his own gravestone--complete with the date of his own death."
A Prayer for Owen MeanyJohn Irving,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/owenmeany/summary.html,"Back in Gravesend and before Owen's funeral, John goes to see the Rev. Merrill. During the meeting, Owen's ghost possesses the reverend and causes him to admit that he is John's father. The reverend claims that he prayed for John's mother to die just before the foul ball hit her, and that, in vengeance, God has turned his face from him. To restore his father's faith, John plays a prank in which he places a dressmaker's dummy in such a way as to make the reverend think he is seeing John's mother's ghost. His faith restored, the reverend delivers a passionate eulogy for Owen, calling him his ""hero"" and pleading for God to give him back."
A Prayer for Owen MeanyJohn Irving,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/owenmeany/summary.html,"In 1968, Owen begins working as a casualty-assistance officer, escorting the bodies of dead soldiers back to their families. One day, he calls John and asks him to meet for a few days in Phoenix, Arizona, where Owen is on assignment. John flies to Phoenix, and he and Owen spend a few days relaxing; John meets the bereaved family Owen is then helping, which comes from a trashy part of town. John especially notices the dead soldier's younger brother, a hulking, menacing fifteen-year-old named Dick Jarvits, who lives for the day he will be able to travel to Vietnam and slaughter the Vietnamese. When John and Owen go to the airport for John's return flight--on the day that Owen believes he is destined to die--they see a group of nuns escorting a column of Vietnamese war orphans through the halls. One of the nuns asks Owen to take the boys to a men's room; there, Dick Jarvits bursts in with a grenade. He hurls it at John, who tosses it to Owen; Owen leaps into the air, and John holds him up so that he can thrust the grenade into a high window alcove--a move exactly like the The Shot. The children are shielded from the blast, but Owen's arms are blown off, and he bleeds to death."

Owen is only able to pay for school by participating in an ROTC program, and he hopes for a combat assignment in Vietnam after graduation, to John and Hester's dismay. He believes that he is destined to die in Vietnam. However, because he is too short to climb over the obstacle-course wall, Owen is given an administrative assignment in Arizona. There, Owen campaigns actively for reassignment in Vietnam. John, meanwhile, attends graduate school.

A Prayer for Owen MeanyJohn Irving,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/owenmeany/summary.html,"Owen is a bizarre child. A tiny dwarf, he has weirdly luminous skin and an ethereally nasal voice (represented in the novel in all-capital letters). He has a tremendous crush on John's mother, who, in turn, is very fond of him; she even intervenes with Owen's parents to ensure that he will be able to attend the elite Gravesend Academy for high school. John does not know who his father is, though he does know his heritage: he comes from the aristocratic Wheelwright family. Owen's parents, in contrast, are undistinguished parents who run a struggling granite quarry. Nonetheless, Owen assures John that God will help him discover the identity of his father. John has always believed that his mother will tell him one day, but this hope is dashed; one day at a Little League game, Owen, ordered to bat for John, hits a high foul ball that falls onto John's mother's head, breaking her neck and killing her. John, brokenhearted, now splits his time between his grandmother's manor at 80 Front Street and his stepfather Dan Needham's apartment at Gravesend Academy, where Dan serves as a history and drama professor. John loves Dan, who becomes like a real father to him."
A Prayer for Owen MeanyJohn Irving,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/owenmeany/summary.html,"Over time, as more and more details of his death are revealed to him, Owen comes to believe that he is God's instrument on Earth, and that he is destined to die heroically. He even believes that God caused him to kill John's mother--he believes that he accidentally interrupted the Angel of Death when it came to take her, and as a result, he was forced to do the job himself. Inscrutably, he begins to make John practice something called ""The Shot,"" a basketball move in which John lifts Owen up for a slam dunk.

A Room of One's OwnVirginia Woolf,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/roomofonesown/summary.html,"The narrator begins her investigation at Oxbridge College, where
she reflects on the different educational experiences available to
men and women as well as on more material differences in their lives.
She then spends a day in the British Library perusing the scholarship
on women, all of which has written by men and all of which has been
written in anger. Turning to history, she finds so little data about
the everyday lives of women that she decides to reconstruct their
existence imaginatively. The figure of Judith Shakespeare is generated
as an example of the tragic fate a highly intelligent woman would
have met with under those circumstances. In light of this background,
she considers the achievements of the major women novelists of the
nineteenth century and reflects on the importance of tradition to
an aspiring writer. A survey of the current state of literature
follows, conducted through a reading the first novel of one of the
narrator's contemporaries. Woolf closes the essay with an exhortation
to her audience of women to take up the tradition that has been
so hardly bequeathed to them, and to increase the endowment for
their own daughters."
A Room of One's OwnVirginia Woolf,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/roomofonesown/summary.html,"The dramatic setting of A Room of One's Own is
that Woolf has been invited to lecture on the topic of Women and
Fiction. She advances the thesis that ""a woman must have money and
a room of her own if she is to write fiction."" Her essay is constructed
as a partly-fictionalized narrative of the thinking that led her
to adopt this thesis. She dramatizes that mental process in the
character of an imaginary narrator (""call me Mary Beton, Mary Seton,
Mary Carmichael or by any name you please—it is not a matter of
any importance"") who is in her same position, wrestling with the
same topic."
A Room with a ViewE.M.

A man she met in Rome, the snobbish Cecil Vyse, proposes marriage to her for the third time, and she accepts him. He disapproves of her family and the country people she knows, finding them coarse and unsophisticated. There is a small, ugly villa available for rent in the town, and as a joke, Cecil offers it to the Emersons, whom he meets by chance in a museum. They take him up on the offer and move in, much to Lucy's initial horror."
A Room with a ViewE.M. Forster,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/room/summary.html,"George is troubled by existential worries in Italy. He doesn't understand how life can be truly joyful and worthwhile when it is always shadowed by enigma, symbolized by the question mark that he hangs on the wall of his hotel. Lucy, though cautious, is loving by nature and enjoys life even when it challenges her understanding. The two are united by a shared appreciation for beauty, which might be captured in their love of views: Lucy adores the view of the Arno through the pension window, while George's first memory is of himself and his parents gazing at a view. Each possesses what the other needs: George finds simple joys staying with the Honeychurch family, while Lucy finds the courage to recognize her own individuality through her contact with the Emersons."
A Room with a ViewE.M. Forster,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/room/summary.html,"However, Lucy will not believe that she loves George; she wants to stay unmarried and travel to Greece with some elderly women she met in Italy, the Miss Alans. She meets old Mr. Emerson by chance, who insists that she loves George and should marry him, because it is what her soul truly wants. Lucy realizes he is right, and though she must fly against convention, she marries George, and the book ends with the happy couple staying together in the Florence pension again, in a room with a view."
A Room with a ViewE.M. Forster,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/room/summary.html,"Having more clearly found herself in Italy, Lucy's real test lies at home, where she must confront her old familiar surroundings. She is still uncertain, however, and confused about what to think about her new experiences. That she missteps and becomes engaged to the pretentious and domineering Cecil shows her susceptibility to the pressures of society. As her bold piano playing suggests, she is cut out for a more daring life, if only she could cut herself away from the restricting social boundaries that engulf her. The Emersons, as free-thinking, modern, truth-loving people, are her deliverers from the grips of society. It is this freedom that allows her to see beyond the dictates of propriety that forbid her marriage to the lower-class George and, therefore, to follow her heart."
A Room with a ViewE.M. Forster,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/room/summary.html,"Lucy's visit to Italy is marked by several significant encounters with the Emersons. In Santa Croce church, George complains that his father means well, but always offends everyone. Mr. Emerson tells Lucy that his son needs her in order to overcome his youthful melancholy. Later, Lucy is walking in the Piazza Signoria, feeling dull, when she comes in close contact with two quarreling Italian men. One man stabs the other, and she faints, to be rescued by George.

After the game, Cecil reads from a book by Miss Lavish, a woman who also stayed with Lucy and Charlotte at the pension in Florence. The novel records a kiss among violets, and Lucy realizes that Charlotte let the secret out. In a moment alone, George kisses her again. Lucy tells him to leave, but George insists that Cecil is not the right man for her, characterizing Cecil as controlling and appreciative of things rather than people. Lucy sees Cecil in a new light, and breaks off her engagement that night."
A Room with a ViewE.M. Forster,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/room/summary.html,"A Room with a View is one of Forster's early works, and is not as complex as the more mature Howard's End and Passage to India. However, its strength lies in its vivid cast of characters, humorous dialogue, and comedic play upon the manners of the day, and in Forster's engaging, sympathetic exploration of Lucy's character."
A Room with a ViewE.M. Forster,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/room/summary.html,"Lucy Honeychurch, a young upper middle class woman, visits Italy under the charge of her older cousin Charlotte.

A Room with a ViewE.M. Forster,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/room/summary.html,"The book depicts Lucy's struggles as she emerges as her own woman, growing from indecision to fulfillment. She struggles between strict, old-fashioned Victorian values and newer, more liberal mores. In this struggle Lucy's own idea of what is true evolves and matures. Her trip to Italy opens her sheltered eyes to ideas and people unlike those she has known growing up in the English countryside. She also notices how freely Italian classes seem to mix, and realizes that the social boundaries she has always regarded as fixed are actually arbitrary. Her experience with the Emersons shows her that there can be beauty in the things that are considered improper, and Charlotte's betrayal shows her that propriety is not always the best judge of what is true."
A Rose for EmilyWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-rose-for-emily/summary.html,"In section IV, the narrator describes the fear that some of the townspeople have that Emily will use the poison to kill herself. Her potential marriage to Homer seems increasingly unlikely, despite their continued Sunday ritual. The more outraged women of the town insist that the Baptist minister talk with Emily. After his visit, he never speaks of what happened and swears that he’ll never go back. So the minister’s wife writes to Emily’s two cousins in Alabama, who arrive for an extended stay. Because Emily orders a silver toilet set monogrammed with Homer’s initials, talk of the couple’s marriage resumes.

Her father has just died, and Emily has been abandoned by the man whom the townsfolk believed Emily was to marry. As complaints mount, Judge Stevens, the mayor at the time, decides to have lime sprinkled along the foundation of the Grierson home in the middle of the night. Within a couple of weeks, the odor subsides, but the townspeople begin to pity the increasingly reclusive Emily, remembering how her great aunt had succumbed to insanity. The townspeople have always believed that the Griersons thought too highly of themselves, with Emily’s father driving off the many suitors deemed not good enough to marry his daughter. With no offer of marriage in sight, Emily is still single by the time she turns thirty."

In section I, the narrator recalls the time of Emily Grierson’s death and how the entire town attended her funeral in her home, which no stranger had entered for more than ten years. In a once-elegant, upscale neighborhood, Emily’s house is the last vestige of the grandeur of a lost era. Colonel Sartoris, the town’s previous mayor, had suspended Emily’s tax responsibilities to the town after her father’s death, justifying the action by claiming that Mr. Grierson had once lent the community a significant sum. As new town leaders take over, they make unsuccessful attempts to get Emily to resume payments. When members of the Board of Aldermen pay her a visit, in the dusty and antiquated parlor, Emily reasserts the fact that she is not required to pay taxes in Jefferson and that the officials should talk to Colonel Sartoris about the matter. However, at that point he has been dead for almost a decade. She asks her servant, Tobe, to show the men out."
A Rose for EmilyWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-rose-for-emily/summary.html,"The day after Mr. Grierson’s death, the women of the town call on Emily to offer their condolences. Meeting them at the door, Emily states that her father is not dead, a charade that she keeps up for three days. She finally turns her father’s body over for burial."
A Rose for EmilyWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-rose-for-emily/summary.html,"In section V, the narrator describes what happens after Emily dies. Emily’s body is laid out in the parlor, and the women, town elders, and two cousins attend the service. After some time has passed, the door to a sealed upstairs room that had not been opened in forty years is broken down by the townspeople. The room is frozen in time, with the items for an upcoming wedding and a man’s suit laid out. Homer Barron’s body is stretched on the bed as well, in an advanced state of decay. The onlookers then notice the indentation of a head in the pillow beside Homer’s body and a long strand of Emily’s gray hair on the pillow."
A Rose for EmilyWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/a-rose-for-emily/summary.html,"After the cousins’ departure, Homer enters the Grierson home one evening and then is never seen again. Holed up in the house, Emily grows plump and gray. Despite the occasional lesson she gives in china painting, her door remains closed to outsiders. In what becomes an annual ritual, Emily refuses to acknowledge the tax bill. She eventually closes up the top floor of the house. Except for the occasional glimpse of her in the window, nothing is heard from her until her death at age seventy-four. Only the servant is seen going in and out of the house."

The summer after her father’s death, the town contracts workers to pave the sidewalks, and a construction company, under the direction of northerner Homer Barron, is awarded the job. Homer soon becomes a popular figure in town and is seen taking Emily on buggy rides on Sunday afternoons, which scandalizes the town and increases the condescension and pity they have for Emily. They feel that she is forgetting her family pride and becoming involved with a man beneath her station."
A Separate PeaceJohn Knowles,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/separate/summary.html,"Gene realizes that he has been grievously mistaken about
the existence of any rivalry between them when, one day, Finny expresses
a sincere desire to see Gene succeed. While still in a state of shock
from the force of his realization, he accompanies Finny to the tree
for their jumping ritual. When Finny reaches the edge of the branch,
Gene’s knees bend, shaking the branch and causing Finny to fall
to the bank and shatter his leg. The tragedy is generally considered
an accident, and no one thinks to blame Gene—especially not Finny.
But when the doctor tells Gene that Finny’s athletic days are over,
Gene feels a piercing sense of guilt. He goes to see Finny and begins
to admit his part in Finny’s fall, but the doctor interrupts him, and
Finny is sent home before Gene gets another chance to confess."
A Separate PeaceJohn Knowles,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/separate/summary.html,"Gene sneaks over to the school’s infirmary that night
to see Finny, who angrily sends him away. Gene wanders the campus
until he falls asleep under the football stadium. The next morning,
he goes to see Finny again, takes full blame for the tragedy, apologizes,
and tries to explain that his action did not arise from hatred.
Finny accepts these statements and the two are reconciled. Later,
as the doctor is operating on Finny’s leg, some marrow detaches
from the bone and enters Finny’s bloodstream, going directly to
his heart and killing him. Gene receives the news with relative
tranquility; he feels that he has become a part of Finny and will
always be with him. The rest of the boys graduate and go off to
enlist in relatively safe branches of the military. Gene reflects
on the constant enmity that plagues the human heart—a curse from
which he believes that only Finny was immune."
A Separate PeaceJohn Knowles,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/separate/summary.html,"Gene Forrester is
a quiet, intellectual student at the Devon School in New Hampshire.
During the summer session of 1942, he becomes close friends with
his daredevil roommate Finny, whose innate charisma consistently allows
him to get away with mischief. Finny prods Gene into making a dangerous
jump out of a tree into a river, and the two start a secret society
based on this ritual. Gene gradually begins to envy Finny’s astonishing
athletic abilities, manifested in Finny’s breaking a school swimming
record on his first try. He thinks that Finny, in turn, envies his
superior academic achievements, and he suspects that his friend
has been taking steps to distract him from his studies. Gene’s suspicions
transform into resentful hatred, but he nevertheless carefully maintains
an appearance of friendship."
A Separate PeaceJohn Knowles,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/separate/summary.html,"Finny tells Gene that he once had aspirations to go to
the Olympics, and Gene agrees to train for the 1944 Olympics in
his place. All the boys are surprised when a gentle, nature-loving
boy named Leper Lepellier becomes the first one in their class to
enlist. Gene and Finny go on training, shielded within their private
vision of world events. During a winter carnival, which Finny has
organized, a telegram arrives for Gene from Leper, saying that he
has “escaped” and desperately needs Gene to come to his home in
Vermont. Gene goes to Vermont and finds that Leper has gone slightly mad.
Leper, who was present at Finny’s accident, reveals that he knows
the truth about what happened. Leper’s ranting frightens Gene and
makes him anxious about how he himself might react to military life.
He runs away back to Devon. When Brinker hears of what has happened
to Leper, he laments in front of Finny that Devon has already lost
two of its potential soldiers—Leper and the crippled Finny. Gene,
afraid that Finny will be hurt by this remark, tries to raise his
spirits by getting him to discuss his conspiracy theory again, but
Finny now denies the war only ironically."

Finny refuses to listen to him, and Gene rescinds his confession and
continues on to school. There, Gene attempts to avoid true athletic
activity by becoming assistant manager of the crew team, but he
feuds with the crew manager and quits. World War II is in full swing
and the boys at Devon are all eager to enlist in the military. Brinker Hadley, a prominent class politician, suggests to Gene that they
enlist together, and Gene agrees. That night, however, he finds Finny
has returned to school. He consequently abandons his plans to enlist,
as does Brinker. Finny expects Gene to take his place as the school’s
sports star now that he is injured. When Gene protests that sports
no longer seem important in the midst of the war, Finny declares
that the war is nothing but a conspiracy to keep young men from
eclipsing the older authorities."

on the makeshift tribunal question the two about the circumstances
surrounding the fall. Finny’s perceptions of the incident remain
so blurred that he cannot speak conclusively on the matter; Gene
maintains that he doesn’t remember the details of it. The boys now
bring in Leper, who was sighted earlier in the day skulking about
the bushes, and Leper begins to implicate Gene. Finny declares that
he does not care about the facts and rushes out of the room. Hurrying

A Small PlaceJamaica Kincaid,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/smallplace/summary.html,"Kincaid discusses the way Antiguans experience the passage of time, and
connects this to their oddly detached view of the corruption of their government.
She then goes into a litany of the many abuses of power on the island, including
misappropriation of funds, kickbacks, drug smuggling, and even political
violence—all of which are known by the average Antiguan. Kincaid then discusses the
political history of Antigua since independence, showing how power has rested in the
same hands for most of the period, with one brief, unimpressive exception. Kincaid
sees corruption as an ingrained element of political life on the island, so much so
that government officials who do not steal are held in contempt as fools rather than
admired for their honesty. She tells of the fears that many Antiguans have for the
future and hints that open dictatorship or political upheaval may lie ahead."
A Small PlaceJamaica Kincaid,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/smallplace/summary.html,"The third section, the longest, deals with Antigua’s present and begins with
Kincaid asking herself the disturbing question of whether, considering the state of
the island today, things weren’t, in fact, better in the old days. As an example,
she takes the state of the library, awaiting repairs after all these years and
forced to reside in “temporary” quarters above a dry goods store. Kincaid has fond,
if ambivalent, feelings toward the old library, which was a haven of beauty and an
escape into reading for her as a child. She recalls the imperious ways of the head
librarian (who suspected Kincaid, rightly, of stealing books), who is now sadly
reduced to campaigning, mostly unsuccessfully, for funds to build a new library,
while the collection decomposes in cardboard boxes. The rich members of the Mill
Reef Club have the funds to help, but will do so only if the old library is
rebuilt—a demand that Kincaid sees as having more to do with nostalgia for the
colonial regime than with a true desire to help. Kincaid mentions the ironies
involved in Antigua having a Minister of Culture without having a culture to
administer. She also mentions her politically active mother’s run-in with the
current Minister of Culture, who has allowed the library to languish. Education has
clearly suffered on Antigua in the years since independence, and Kincaid ruefully
notes the poor speech habits of the younger Antiguans."
A Small PlaceJamaica Kincaid,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/smallplace/summary.html,"The fourth, and final, section is a sort of coda to the piece, starting with
an evocation of the intense physical beauty of the island. She describes the beauty
as so extreme as to appear “unreal,” almost like an illustration or a stage-set.
Kincaid says that the beauty of their surroundings is a mixed blessing to the
Antiguans, who are trapped in an unchanging setting in which their poverty is part
of the scenery. The slaves who were brought to Antigua by force were victims, and
therefore noble—but their descendants, today’s Antiguans, are simple human beings,
with all the problems and contradictions of human beings anywhere."
A Small PlaceJamaica Kincaid,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/smallplace/summary.html,"The second section deals with Kincaid’s memories of the “old” Antigua, the
colonial possession of Great Britain. Kincaid recalls the casual racism of the
times, and the subservience of Antigua to England and, especially, to English
culture. She delves briefly into the history of Barclay’s Bank and discusses the
Mill Reef Club, an elite, all-white enclave built by wealthy foreigners. She
describes and deplores the great hoopla made over the visit of Princess Margaret to
the island when Kincaid was a child. Much of the section is concerned with the
distortions that colonialism has created in the minds of the Antiguans; Antiguans do
not tend to recognize racism as such, says Kincaid, and the bad behavior of
individual English people never seems to affect the general reverence for English
culture. For Kincaid, the problem is compounded by the fact that the people of
Antigua can express themselves only in the language of those who enslaved and
oppressed them. She then discusses the connection she sees between the colonial past
of the island and its impoverished, corrupt present."
A Small PlaceJamaica Kincaid,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/smallplace/summary.html,"A Small Place is divided into four loosely structured, untitled
sections. The first section begins with Kincaid’s narration of the reader’s
experiences and thoughts as a hypothetical tourist in Antigua. The reader, through
Kincaid’s description, witnesses the great natural beauty of the island, while being
sheltered from the harsher realities of the lives of those who must live there.
Kincaid weaves into her narrative the sort of information that only an “insider”
would know, such as the reason why the majority of the automobiles on the island are
poorly running, expensive Japanese cars. Included in her guided tour are brief views
of the mansions on the island, mostly gained through corruption or outright
criminality. She also mentions the now-dilapidated library, still awaiting repairs
after an earthquake ten years earlier. The tour continues at the hotel, and Kincaid
concludes the section with a discussion of her view of the moral ugliness of being a
tourist."

Laurel, Mississippi, arrives at the New Orleans apartment of her
sister, Stella Kowalski. Despite the fact that Blanche seems to have
fallen out of close contact with Stella, she intends to stay at
Stella’s apartment for an unspecified but likely lengthy period
of time, given the large trunk she has with her. Blanche tells Stella
that she lost Belle Reve, their ancestral home, following the death
of all their remaining relatives. She also mentions that she has
been given a leave of absence from her teaching position because
of her bad nerves."

afford a hotel, she is disdainful of the cramped quarters of the
Kowalskis’ two-room apartment and of the apartment’s location in
a noisy, diverse, working-class neighborhood. Blanche’s social condescension
wins her the instant dislike of Stella’s husband, an auto-parts supply
man of Polish descent named Stanley Kowalski. It is clear that Stella
was happy to leave behind her the social pretensions of her background
in exchange for the sexual gratification she gets from her husband;
she even is pregnant with his baby. Stanley immediately distrusts
Blanche to the extent that he suspects her of having cheated Stella
out of her share of the family inheritance. In the process of defending
herself to Stanley, Blanche reveals that Belle Reve was lost due
to a foreclosed mortgage, a disclosure that signifies the dire nature
of Blanche’s financial circumstances. Blanche’s heavy drinking,

Charles Darnay stands accused of treason against the English crown.
A bombastic lawyer named Stryver pleads Darnay’s case, but it is
not until his drunk, good-for-nothing colleague, Sydney Carton,
assists him that the court acquits Darnay. Carton clinches his argument
by pointing out that he himself bears an uncanny resemblance to
the defendant, which undermines the prosecution’s case for unmistakably
identifying Darnay as the spy the authorities spotted. Lucie and
Doctor Manette watched the court proceedings, and that night, Carton
escorts Darnay to a tavern and asks how it feels to receive the
sympathy of a woman like Lucie. Carton despises and resents Darnay

have been."

in Manette’s old jail cell in the Bastille. The letter explains
the cause of Manette’s imprisonment. Years ago, the brothers Evrémonde
(Darnay’s father and uncle) enlisted Manette’s medical assistance.
They asked him to tend to a woman, whom one of the brothers had
raped, and her brother, whom the same brother had stabbed fatally.
Fearing that Manette might report their misdeeds, the Evrémondes
had him arrested. Upon hearing this story, the jury condemns Darnay for
the crimes of his ancestors and sentences him to die within twenty-four
hours. That night, at the Defarge’s wine shop, Carton overhears
Madame Defarge plotting to have Lucie and her daughter (also Darnay’s
daughter) executed as well; Madame Defarge, it turns out, is the
surviving sibling of the man and woman killed by the Evrémondes.
Carton arranges for the Manettes’ immediate departure from France.
He then visits Darnay in prison, tricks him into changing clothes
with him, and, after dictating a letter of explanation, drugs his
friend unconscious. Barsad carries Darnay, now disguised as Carton,

Apparently, Mrs. Cheveley's dead mentor, Baron Arnheim, convinced the young Sir Robert many years ago to sell him a Cabinet secret, a secret that suggested he buy stocks in the Suez Canal three days before the British government announced its purchase.

When Sir Robert refuses Lord Goring his sister's hand in marriage, still believing he has taken up with Mrs. Cheveley, Lady Chiltern is forced to explain last night's events and the true nature of the letter. Sir Robert relents, and Lord Goring and Mabel are permitted to wed."

An Inspector CallsJ. B. Priestley,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/an-inspector-calls/summary.html,"The Inspector, whom Arthur does not know despite his positions in local government, announces that a girl named Eva Smith has died of an apparent suicide. The Inspector asks Arthur if he knows anyone by that name. Arthur initially denies it, but after seeing a picture, he admits to employing Eva at his factory, and firing her when she incites a failed strike for higher wages. Arthur says he is not sorry for doing so, even though he is sad to hear of the girl’s death. Arthur believes that his foremost obligation is to his profits. When Sheila returns to the room, the Inspector begins interrogating her. It is revealed that Sheila got a girl fired from Milward’s, a local shop, for giving Sheila mean looks as she was trying on clothing. Sheila regrets to hear that the person she incriminated was none other than Eva Smith, and that she and Arthur are responsible, in part, for Eva’s poverty and suicide."
An Inspector CallsJ. B. Priestley,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/an-inspector-calls/summary.html,"Sheila wonders whether this would excuse everyone’s behavior, but it does not, as Gerald still committed his affair, Eric impregnated an unmarried girl, and Arthur and Sybil behaved uncharitably to young girls in need. Arthur calls the hospital and confirms that no self-inflicted deaths have been recorded for weeks. He says resolutely that Inspector Goole has tricked the family and that there is nothing to fear. Sheila worries aloud that Arthur will ignore the lessons the family was just beginning to learn. The phone rings, and Arthur answers. He alerts the family that a girl has been admitted to the hospital just now, and that her death is a suicide. As the play ends, Arthur relays to the family that a police inspector is headed to the house to begin an inquiry."
An Inspector CallsJ. B. Priestley,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/an-inspector-calls/summary.html,"The Inspector turns to Gerald and asks if he knows someone named Daisy Renton. Sheila realizes, from Gerald’s expression, that Gerald knows this name. When all but Sheila and Gerald leave the room, Sheila accuses Gerald of having had an affair with Daisy Renton the previous summer. Gerald admits to this. He asks Sheila to hide this information from the Inspector, but she says it won’t be possible because the Inspector probably already knows. Act One ends."
An Inspector CallsJ. B. Priestley,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/an-inspector-calls/summary.html,"Act Two begins with the same set. The Inspector questions Gerald about Daisy Renton, and Gerald admits to the affair in front of Sheila and her parents, Arthur and Sybil. Gerald is embarrassed by his indiscretion, but insists his concern for Daisy was authentic. Sheila wonders if she can forgive Gerald enough to continue their relationship. Gerald tells the Inspector he is going to leave for a walk."
An Inspector CallsJ. B. Priestley,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/an-inspector-calls/summary.html,"The Inspector moves on to Sybil, who, on being questioned, says that she, as director of a charity, refused assistance to a pregnant woman. The Inspector tells them that the girl Sybil turned away was Eva Smith, or, as Gerald knew her, Daisy Renton. The Inspector also says that Gerald was not the one who got Eva pregnant. Sybil says she feels no regret, as Eva/Daisy had claimed she was pregnant but was not married to the child’s father. To this, Sybil responded that Eva/Daisy should ask the child’s father for money. Sybil blames the unnamed father for the situation, and for Eva/Daisy’s suicide. Sheila and Arthur tell Sybil to stop talking. In this moment, Sybil realizes that her son, Eric, must be the father of the child, since Eva/Daisy presented herself to the charity as “Mrs. Birling.” Eric returns to the room. Act Two ends."
An Inspector CallsJ. B. Priestley,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/an-inspector-calls/summary.html,"In Act Three, with the same set, Eric admits to an affair with Eva/Daisy, and to a drinking problem that makes many of the details hazy. The Inspector demonstrates that each member of the Birling family, and Gerald, has played a part in Eva/Daisy’s suicide, and that all should consider themselves guilty. Before he leaves, the Inspector says that people must look out for one another, and that society is “one body.” The Inspector departs. Sheila, wracked with guilt, wonders aloud whether the Inspector is a member of the police force. The family puzzles this out, and when Gerald returns, he says he spoke to a sergeant outside who does not know of any Inspector with the name of Goole, the man who just visited the Birling home. Arthur believes that the family has been hoaxed, and that this is a good thing, since their misdeeds will not now result in public scandal. Sheila resents Arthur’s rationalization of the family’s behavior, and she says they are still guilty for Eva/Daisy’s death, even if the Inspector was not a genuine officer. Gerald, however, notes that no family member saw the picture of Eva/Daisy at the same time, and that the Inspector might have conflated the family’s stories by offering pictures of different women, and changing the names from Eva Smith to Daisy Renton."

Arthur Birling has convened a dinner for the engagement of his daughter, Sheila, to her boyfriend, Gerald Croft. Arthur and his wife Sybil seem happy, although Sybil is reserved at the meal. Eric, Sheila’s brother, drinks heavily and appears mildly upset. Gerald gives Sheila her ring, and Sheila and Sybil leave the room to try on wedding clothes. Eric goes upstairs. Arthur tells Gerald he knows the Croft family considers themselves social superiors of the Birlings, but that’s easily remedied, he says, as he expects a knighthood for his business successes. Gerald promises to relay the news to his mother. Eric returns, and Arthur gives the two young men advice about professional life, saying that people ought to look out for themselves and their families, and not fall prey to socialist propaganda about the collective good.

An Occurrence at Owl Creek BridgeAmbrose Bierce,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/an-occurrence-at-owl-creek-bridge/summary.html,"In section II, we learn that Farquhar was a successful planter, ardently devoted to the Southern cause. Unable to join the Confederate army, he yearned to help the South’s war effort in some significant way. One evening in the past, Farquhar and his wife were sitting on the edge of their property when a gray-clad soldier rode up, seeking a drink of water. The soldier appeared to be from the Confederate army. While his wife was fetching the water, Farquhar asked for news of the front and was informed that Northern forces had repaired the railroads in anticipation of launching another advance, having already reached the Owl Creek bridge. Any civilian caught interfering with the North’s efforts in the area, the soldier went on to reveal, would be hanged. Farquhar asked how a civilian could attempt some form of sabotage. The soldier told him that one could easily set fire to the driftwood that had piled up near the bridge after the past winter’s flood. The man, who was actually a Northern scout in disguise, finished his drink and rode off, only to pass by an hour later heading in the opposite direction."
An Occurrence at Owl Creek BridgeAmbrose Bierce,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/an-occurrence-at-owl-creek-bridge/summary.html,"Farquhar then hears the lieutenant instructing his men to fire, so he dives down to avoid the shots. He quickly removes a piece of metal that sticks in his neck. Farquhar comes back up for air as the soldiers reload, and the sentinels fire again from the bridge. Swimming with the current, Farquhar realizes that a barrage of gunfire is about to come his way. A cannonball lands two yards away, sending a sheet of spray crashing over him. The deflected shot goes smashing into the trees beyond. Farquhar believes they will next fire a spray of grapeshot from the cannon, instead of a single ball, and he will have to anticipate the firing. Suddenly he is spun into a disorienting whirl, then ejected from the river onto a gravelly bank out of sight and range of his would-be executioners and their gunfire."
An Occurrence at Owl Creek BridgeAmbrose Bierce,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/an-occurrence-at-owl-creek-bridge/summary.html,"“An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge” is divided into three sections. In section I, Peyton Farquhar is standing on a railroad bridge, twenty feet above the water. His wrists are bound behind his back, and around his neck is a noose that is tied to a beam overhead. He is positioned on loose planks that have been laid over the crossties of the train tracks to create a makeshift platform. Two soldiers from the Northern army, a sergeant, and a captain immediately surround him, awaiting the execution. Beyond them, armed sentinels stand at attention. The bridge is bordered on one side by forest and, across the stream, open ground that gives way to a small hillock on which a small fort has been erected. A motionless company of infantrymen, led by their lieutenant, stands assembled before the fort. As the two soldiers finalize the preparations, they step back and remove the individual planks on which they had been standing. The sergeant salutes the captain then positions himself on the opposite end of the board supporting Farquhar, as the captain, like the soldiers, steps off and away from the crossties."
An Occurrence at Owl Creek BridgeAmbrose Bierce,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/an-occurrence-at-owl-creek-bridge/summary.html,"He weeps with joy and marvels at the landscape, having no desire to put any more distance between him and his pursuers, when a volley of grapeshot overhead rouses him. He heads into the forest, setting his path by the sun and traveling the entire day. The thought of his family urges him on. Taking a remote road, he finds himself in the early morning standing at the gate of his home. As he walks toward the house, his wife steps down from the verandah to meet him. He moves to embrace her but feels a sharp blow on the back of his neck and sees a blinding white light all about him. Then silence and darkness engulf him. Farquhar is dead, his broken body actually swinging from the side of the Owl Creek bridge."
An Occurrence at Owl Creek BridgeAmbrose Bierce,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/an-occurrence-at-owl-creek-bridge/summary.html,"Section III brings us back to the present, at the hanging. Farquhar loses consciousness as he plummets down from the side of the bridge. He is awakened by currents of pain running through his body. A loud splash wakes him up even more abruptly, and he realizes that the noose has broken—sending him falling into the stream below. Farquhar sees a light flicker and fade before it strengthens and brightens as he rises, with some trepidation, to the surface. He is afraid he will be shot by Northern soldiers as soon as he is spotted in the water. Freeing his bound hands, then lifting the noose from his neck, he fights extreme pain to break through the surface and take a large gasp of air, which he exhales with a shriek. Farquhar looks back to see his executioners standing on the bridge, in silhouette against the sky. One of the sentinels fires his rifle at him twice. Farquhar can see the gray eye of the marksman through the gun’s sights."
An Occurrence at Owl Creek BridgeAmbrose Bierce,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/an-occurrence-at-owl-creek-bridge/summary.html,"Awaiting the captain’s signal, the sergeant is about to likewise step away, sending Farquhar to dangle from the bridge’s edge. Farquhar stares into the swirling water below. He watches a piece of driftwood being carried downstream and notes how sluggish the stream seems to be. He shuts his eyes to push away the distractions of his present situation and focus more intently on thoughts of his wife and children. He suddenly hears a sharp, metallic ringing, which sounds both distant and close by. The sound turns out to be the ticking of his watch. Opening his eyes and peering again into the water, Farquhar imagines freeing his hands, removing the noose, and plunging into the stream, swimming to freedom and his home, safely located outside enemy lines. These thoughts have barely registered in Farquhar’s mind when the captain nods to the sergeant and the sergeant steps away from the board."

for the better. The hostages realize that aside from the three generals

The hostages begin to act parental with the young terrorists. They

Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"Afterward, Paul D comes back to Sethe, who has retreated
to Baby Suggs’s bed to die. Mourning Beloved, Sethe laments, “She was
my best thing.” But Paul D replies, “You your best thing, Sethe.”
The novel then ends with a warning that “[t]his is not a story to
pass on.” The town, and even the residents of 124,
have forgotten Beloved “[l]ike an unpleasant dream during a troubling
sleep.”"
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"When Paul D learns the story of Sethe’s “rough choice”—her infanticide—he
leaves 124 and begins sleeping in the basement
of the local church. In his absence, Sethe and Beloved’s relationship becomes
more intense and exclusive. Beloved grows increasingly abusive,
manipulative, and parasitic, and Sethe is obsessed with satisfying
Beloved’s demands and making her understand why she murdered her.
Worried by the way her mother is wasting away, Denver leaves the
premises of 124 for the first time in twelve
years in order to seek help from Lady Jones, her former teacher.
The community provides the family with food and eventually organizes
under the leadership of Ella, a woman who had worked on the Underground
Railroad and helped with Sethe’s escape, in order to exorcise Beloved
from 124. When they arrive at Sethe’s house,
they see Sethe on the porch with Beloved, who stands smiling at
them, naked and pregnant. Mr. Bodwin, who has come to 124 to
take Denver to her new job, arrives at the house. Mistaking him
for schoolteacher, Sethe runs at Mr. Bodwin with an ice pick. She
is restrained, but in the confusion Beloved disappears, never to
return."
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"Sethe spends twenty-eight wonderful days in Cincinnati,
where Baby Suggs serves as an unofficial preacher to the black community. On
the last day, however, schoolteacher comes for Sethe to take her and
her children back to Sweet Home. Rather than surrender her children
to a life of dehumanizing slavery, she flees with them to the woodshed
and tries to kill them. Only the third child, her older daughter,
dies, her throat having been cut with a handsaw by Sethe. Sethe
later arranges for the baby’s headstone to be carved with the word
“Beloved.” The sheriff takes Sethe and Denver to jail, but a group
of white abolitionists, led by the Bodwins, fights for her release.
Sethe returns to the house at 124, where Baby Suggs has sunk into
a deep depression. The community shuns the house, and the family
continues to live in isolation."
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"Paul D’s arrival at 124 commences
the series of events taking place in the present time frame. Prior
to moving in, Paul D chases the house’s resident ghost away, which
makes the already lonely Denver resent him from the start. Sethe
and Paul D look forward to a promising future together, until one
day, on their way home from a carnival, they encounter a strange
young woman sleeping near the steps of 124.
Most of the characters believe that the woman—who calls herself
Beloved—is the embodied spirit of Sethe’s dead daughter, and the
novel provides a wealth of evidence supporting this interpretation.
Denver develops an obsessive attachment to Beloved, and Beloved’s
attachment to Sethe is equally if not more intense. Paul D and Beloved
hate each other, and Beloved controls Paul D by moving him around
the house like a rag doll and by seducing him against his will."
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"Schoolteacher and his nephews anticipate the
slaves’ escape, however, and capture Paul D and Sixo. Schoolteacher
kills Sixo and brings Paul D back to Sweet Home, where Paul D sees
Sethe for what he believes will be the last time. She is still intent
on running, having already sent her children ahead to her mother-in-law
Baby Suggs’s house in Cincinnati. Invigorated by the recent capture,
schoolteacher’s nephews seize Sethe in the barn and violate her,
stealing the milk her body is storing for her infant daughter. Unbeknownst
to Sethe, Halle is watching the event from a loft above her, where
he lies frozen with horror. Afterward, Halle goes mad: Paul D sees
him sitting by a churn with butter slathered all over his face.
Paul D, meanwhile, is forced to suffer the indignity of wearing
an iron bit in his mouth."
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"When schoolteacher finds out that Sethe has reported his
and his nephews’ misdeeds to Mrs. Garner, he has her whipped severely, despite
the fact that she is pregnant. Swollen and scarred, Sethe nevertheless
runs away, but along the way she collapses from exhaustion in a
forest. A white girl, Amy Denver, finds her and nurses her back
to health. When Amy later helps Sethe deliver her baby in a boat,
Sethe names this second daughter Denver after the girl who helped
her. Sethe receives further help from Stamp Paid, who rows her across
the Ohio River to Baby Suggs’s house. Baby Suggs cleans Sethe up
before allowing her to see her three older children."
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"From these fragmented memories, the following
story begins to emerge: Sethe, the protagonist, was born in the
South to an African mother she never knew. When she is thirteen,
she is sold to the Garners, who own Sweet Home and practice a comparatively
benevolent kind of slavery. There, the other slaves, who are all
men, lust after her but never touch her. Their names are Sixo, Paul
D, Paul A, Paul F, and Halle. Sethe chooses to marry Halle, apparently
in part because he has proven generous enough to buy his mother’s
freedom by hiring himself out on the weekends. Together, Sethe and
Halle have two sons, Howard and Buglar, as well as a baby daughter
whose name we never learn. When she leaves Sweet Home, Sethe is
also pregnant with a fourth child. After the eventual death of the
proprietor, Mr. Garner, the widowed Mrs. Garner asks her sadistic,
vehemently racist brother-in-law to help her run the farm. He is
known to the slaves as schoolteacher, and his oppressive presence
makes life on the plantation even more unbearable than it had been
before. The slaves decide to run."
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"On the day the novel begins, Paul D, whom Sethe
has not seen since they worked together on Mr. Garner’s Sweet Home
plantation in Kentucky approximately twenty years earlier, stops
by Sethe’s house. His presence resurrects memories that have lain
buried in Sethe’s mind for almost two decades. From this point on,
the story will unfold on two temporal planes. The present in Cincinnati
constitutes one plane, while a series of events that took place
around twenty years earlier, mostly in Kentucky, constitutes the
other. This latter plane is accessed and described through the fragmented
flashbacks of the major characters. Accordingly, we frequently read
these flashbacks several times, sometimes from varying perspectives,
with each successive narration of an event adding a little more
information to the previous ones."
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"Meanwhile, Paul D has endured torturous experiences in
a chain gang in Georgia, where he was sent after trying to kill
Brandywine, a slave owner to whom he was sold by schoolteacher.
His traumatic experiences have caused him to lock away his memories,
emotions, and ability to love in the “tin tobacco box”
of his heart. One day, a fortuitous rainstorm allows Paul D and
the other chain gang members to escape. He travels northward by
following the blossoming spring flowers. Years later, he ends up
on Sethe’s porch in Cincinnati."
Beloved,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/beloved/summary.html,"Beloved begins in 1873 in
Cincinnati, Ohio, where Sethe, a former slave, has been living with
her eighteen-year-old daughter Denver. Sethe’s mother-in-law, Baby
Suggs, lived with them until her death eight years earlier. Just
before Baby Suggs’s death, Sethe’s two sons, Howard and Buglar, ran
away. Sethe believes they fled because of the malevolent presence
of an abusive ghost that has haunted their house at 124 Bluestone
Road for years. Denver, however, likes the ghost, which everyone
believes to be the spirit of her dead sister."
"Billy Budd, SailorHerman Melville",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/billybudd/summary.html,"Finally, the legend of Billy Budd becomes recorded and
institutionalized in naval circles. A newspaper reports the incident
from afar, implicating Billy Budd as the villainous assailant of
an innocent Claggart. The sailors themselves, however, begin to
revere Billy’s growing legend, treating the spar from his gallows
as a holy object, and composing laudatory verse in his memory."
"Billy Budd, SailorHerman Melville",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/billybudd/summary.html,"During a tense period of deliberation, Vere hovers over
the jury. When they seem to be deadlocked, unable to make a decision,
Vere steps forward to declare his conviction that the rule of law
must supersede the reservations of conscience. He concludes his
speech to the jury by insisting that they decide to acquit or condemn
in strict accordance with the letter of military law. After a period
of further deliberation, the jury finds Billy Budd guilty as charged
and sentences him to death by hanging on the following morning."
"Billy Budd, SailorHerman Melville",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/billybudd/summary.html,"Somewhat later, after a brief skirmish with an enemy
frigate, Claggart approaches Captain Vere with news of a rumored
mutiny and names Billy Budd as the ringleader of the rebellion.
Vere summons Billy to his cabin and instructs Claggart to repeat
his accusation. Upon hearing of this unexpected blot on his character,
Billy is rendered speechless. Vere commands Billy to defend himself,
but then, noticing Billy’s tendency to stutter, softens his approach.
Left with no other means of defense, and twisted into a rage at
Claggart’s outrageous words against him, Billy strikes out in a
fury, giving Claggart a swift punch to the forehead."

and he lies bleeding from the nose and ears as Billy and Vere attempt
to revive him. Abandoning this effort, Vere dismisses Billy to a
neighboring stateroom until further notice. The ship’s surgeon pronounces
Claggart dead after a brief examination, and Captain Vere summons
a group of his senior officers to the cabin."
"Billy Budd, SailorHerman Melville",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/billybudd/summary.html,"After Billy’s death, the crew begins to murmur, but the
officers quickly disperse them to various tasks. Whistles blow and
the ship returns to regular business. In the ensuing days, sailors
engage in various discussions concerning Billy’s fate and the mysterious
circumstances of his expiration. On its return voyage, the Bellipotent falls
in with a French warship, the Athée, or Atheist. Captain

as his last words, “Billy Budd, Billy Budd.”"
"Billy Budd, SailorHerman Melville",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/billybudd/summary.html,"The setting is the last decade of
the eighteenth century. The British naval warship H.M.S. Bellipotent impresses,
or involuntarily recruits, the young sailor Billy Budd, extracting
him from duty aboard the Rights-of-Man, a merchant
ship. Billy’s commanding officer, Captain Graveling, though reluctant
to let one of his best men go, has little choice in the face of
the superior ship’s demands. Billy packs up his gear without so
much as a protest and follows the boarding officer of the Bellipotent, Lieutenant
Ratcliffe, across the gangway to his new assignment. After a cheery
good-bye to his old mates, Billy settles in quickly among the company
of the Bellipotent. He proves most industrious
and eager in his role as foretopman and soon earns the affection
of his more experienced fellow sailors."
"Billy Budd, SailorHerman Melville",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/billybudd/summary.html,"Shortly thereafter, at a lunchtime meal, Billy accidentally
spills his soup pan in the ship’s dining room after a sudden lurch.
The contents of the pan trickle to the feet of the passing Claggart,
who makes an offhand, seemingly lighthearted remark in recognition
of the spill. His comment elicits a stream of obligatory laughter
from the ship’s company, and Billy interprets the event as proof
of Claggart’s approval. But Claggart is offended by the accident,
and finds it indicative of Billy’s contempt for him. He fixates
on the accident as proof of Billy’s hostility, and his assistant
Squeak resolves to increase his surreptitious persecutions of Billy
in recompense."
"Billy Budd, SailorHerman Melville",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/billybudd/summary.html,"Billy is deeply affected by the sight of a violent lashing
given to one of the ship’s crew. Hoping to avoid a similar punishment,
Billy attempts to fulfill his duties in model fashion, but finds
himself under constant scrutiny due to various minor infractions.
Puzzled by this persecution, Billy seeks out the advice of the Dansker,
an aged, experienced sailor. After explaining the situation to him,
the Dansker concludes that Claggart, the master-at-arms, holds a grudge
against Billy. Refusing to accept this theory, Billy dismisses the
Dansker’s opinion but continues to wonder pensively about his situation."
"Billy Budd, SailorHerman Melville",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/billybudd/summary.html,"That morning, shortly after four A.M.,
Billy is hanged in the mainyard of the ship. As the crew watches
him being strung up, preparing to die, they hear him utter his last

calm as dawn breaks over the horizon."

of the captain of the marines, the first lieutenant, and the sailing
master. Vere, functioning as the main witness, gives a testimony
of the relevant events to the jury. Billy remains rather silent
during his period of questioning, admitting to the blow but maintaining
his innocence of intention and declaring his lack of affiliation
with any potential mutiny. The court dismisses Billy again to the
stateroom."

cooperation. Without comprehending the exact details of this solicitation,
Billy recognizes that something is amiss, and he raises his stuttering
voice and threatens the man with uncharacteristic violence. The
conspirator quickly slinks into the darkness, and Billy finds himself
confronted with the curious inquiries of two fellow sailors. Unsure
of how to explain the situation, Billy explains that he simply happened upon
a fellow sailor who was in the wrong part of the ship, and chased
the man back to his proper station with a gruff rebuke."
Bird by BirdAnne Lamott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/birdbybird/summary.html,"Part Two examines “The Writing Frame of Mind.” Lamott implores
writers to remain aware of and reverent toward the world around
them. She also states that good writing must be moral. By this she
means that one’s writing must be driven by one’s deepest beliefs,
as it is this level of passion that creates the best writing. Lamott
calls the critical voices in her head Radio Station KFKD (a name that
becomes hilarious when pronounced aloud) and frequently concentrates
on silencing them. These voices can lead to jealousy, a trait which
she denounces as one of the worst handicaps a writer can possess.
Jealousy of other writers—or anyone else—is counterproductive and
should be avoided at all costs."
Bird by BirdAnne Lamott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/birdbybird/summary.html,"In Part Four, Lamott reminds her readers that their writing
can be a gift. She frequently uses writing in her own life in order
to memorialize someone for whom she cares deeply. She discusses
her writing as a reaction to the deaths of her father and her friend
Pam. Writing about these events helped her come to terms with her
grief. Lamott goes on to demand that her students find their own
voice. Her students often mimic famous writers, which prohibits
them from writing truthfully. She implores them not to shy away
from detailing the more uncomfortable moments in their lives; in
fact, it is these moments that often lead to the best writing. Briefly,
Lamott touches on the much-hyped process of publishing. She recalls
her intense anxieties during the process of publishing and notes
that while there are some pleasurable moments, publication itself
is not enough to make a writer happy."
Bird by BirdAnne Lamott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/birdbybird/summary.html,"Lamott then addresses the more technical details of writing, comparing
the process of writing to the slow development of a Polaroid picture.
Characters develop organically, and writers must foster this development
by loving each of their characters. Each character should be readily
identifiable by what he or she says, and in most cases the narrator
should be a lovable figure. Also, good dialogue is integral to a
story. Plot should develop from character, and writers shouldn’t
try to cram characters into plots that don’t suit them. She points
out that a good plot treatment (i.e., a brief summation of what
happens in the story) can be a valuable tool for a story that is
in trouble. She recalls a book of hers that was rejected by her editor
even after multiple revisions. Only when she described the plot
treatment did her editor understand the problem: the story that existed
on paper was far different from the one that existed in Lamott’s
head."
Bird by BirdAnne Lamott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/birdbybird/summary.html,"Lamott concludes that being a writer is the best life
she can imagine. For her, the best thing about being a writer is
the pride she feels at producing such satisfying work. Writing feeds
Lamott’s soul and helps her to love the world. Bird by Bird expresses
her desire to share the joy that writing brings to her life."
Bird by BirdAnne Lamott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/birdbybird/summary.html,"Lamott begins Bird by Bird with
an introduction describing her lifelong love of books and her father’s
influence on her life and writing. Although she often wished that her
father had a “regular” job like other fathers, she gradually began
to realize that being a writer was the best job for him. She eventually
followed in his footsteps. At an early age, Lamott realized that
she possessed an uncanny ability to write engaging and often funny
stories. But even with this ability, she was not an instant success
as a writer. When her father fell ill with brain cancer, she was
inspired to write about her family’s struggles. Her father’s agent
accepted her manuscript, which was eventually published, and Lamott
has worked as a writer ever since. She wrote Bird by Bird in
order to share with the reader everything she knows about writing."
Bird by BirdAnne Lamott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/birdbybird/summary.html,"In Part One, Lamott addresses the daunting task of beginning
to write. She talks about how writers should strive to write at
the same time every day and urges them to give themselves short,
discrete assignments rather than long, complicated ones. She keeps
a one-inch picture frame on her desk that reminds her to write about
small things in detail before embarking on large projects. Often,
these small exercises lead to valuable writing material, as in her
anecdote about school lunches. In the writing exercise that describes
a lunch preparation, Lamott explains how the process of writing
about mundane details provides the seeds of an interesting story.
Lamott also encourages writers to give themselves permission to
write imperfect first drafts, since this is an integral part of
story development. Self-criticism and perfectionism can be writers’
worst enemies, but writers must somehow continue to write even as
self-doubt plagues them. Lamott finds it helpful to believe in God
or another higher power when fighting these enemies, and her spirituality
permeates Bird by Bird."
Bird by BirdAnne Lamott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/birdbybird/summary.html,"In Part Three, Lamott emphasizes the importance of community in
writing. She thinks that writer’s groups can be a good source of community,
but that they can also be hotbeds of criticism. Writers must be
extremely discriminating when deciding with whom to share their
writing. She stresses the importance of having another person read
your writing. Someone else’s input is extremely valuable, especially
for beginning writers. When her students are stumped, she suggests
that they write to friends and family about important events in
their lives. This exercise often triggers important memories that
can serve as fodder for writing. Finally she addresses the curse
of writer’s block: patience and faith are the only real cures. A
block will always pass, she believes."

Richard closely associates his family’s hardship—and particularly
their hunger—with his father and therefore grows bitter toward him."
Black BoyRichard Wright,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/blackboy/summary.html,"Meanwhile, Richard picks his way through school. He delights in
his studies—particularly reading and writing—despite a home climate
hostile to such pursuits. To the bafflement and scorn of everyone,
he writes and publishes in a local black newspaper a story titled
“The Voodoo of Hell’s Half-Acre.” He graduates from the ninth grade
as valedictorian, giving his own speech despite the insistence
of his principal, friends, and family that he give a school-sanctioned
speech to appease the white audience."
Black Like MeJohn Howard Griffin,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/blacklikeme/summary.html,"In Atlanta, Griffin conducts a long series of interviews with black leaders before returning to New Orleans to make a photographic record of his time there. He then goes off his medication entirely, permanently returning his skin color to white. He returns home to his family and writes his article, which is published in March 1960. After the article appears, Griffin is called on to do interviews with prominent television shows and newsmagazines. The story of his amazing experience quickly spreads around the world, and he receives a flood of congratulatory mail. In Mansfield, however, the prevalent attitude is that of racism, and Griffin and his family become the subject of hateful reprisals. An effigy of Griffin, painted half white and half black, is burned on Main Street; a cross is burned in a Negro schoolyard; threats are made against Griffin, including one to castrate him. By August, things are so bad that he has decided to move his family to Mexico. Before he goes, he has a talk with a little black boy, to whom he explains that racism is a result of social conditioning, not any inherent quality within blacks or whites. He issues a plea for tolerance and understanding between the races, fearing that, if the current conflict is sustained, it will explode in an outbreak of terrible violence."
Black Like MeJohn Howard Griffin,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/blacklikeme/summary.html,"In general, Griffin finds that conditions for blacks are appalling, and that black communities seem run-down and defeated. He even notices a look of defeat and hopelessness on his own face, after only a few weeks as a black man. In Montgomery, however, the black community is charged with determination and energy by the example of one of its leaders, a preacher named Marin Luther King, Jr. Blacks in Montgomery have begun practicing passive resistance, a nonviolent form of refusing to comply with racist laws and rules. Griffin, again depressed and weary of life as a black man, briefly stops taking his medication and lightens his skin back to his normal color. He begins alternating back and forth between races, visiting a place first as a black man and then as a white man. He notices immediately that when he is a white man, whites treat him with respect and blacks treat him with suspicious fear; when he is a black man, blacks treat him with generosity and warmth, while whites treat him with hostility and contempt. Griffin concludes that the races do not understand one another at all, and that a tolerant dialogue is needed to bridge the terrible gap separating them."
Black Like MeJohn Howard Griffin,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/blacklikeme/summary.html,"John Howard Griffin, the author and main character of Black Like Me, is a middle-aged white man living in Mansfield, Texas in 1959. Deeply committed to the cause of racial justice and frustrated by his inability as a white man to understand the black experience, Griffin decides to take a radical step: he decides to undergo medical treatment to change the color of his skin and temporarily become a black man. After securing the support of his wife and of George Levitan, the editor of a black-oriented magazine called Sepia which will fund Griffin's experience in return for an article about it, Griffin sets out for New Orleans to begin his life as a black man. He finds a contact in the black community, a soft-spoken, articulate shoe-shiner named Sterling Williams, and begins a dermatological regimen of exposure to ultraviolet light, oral medication, and skin dyes. Eventually, Griffin looks in the mirror and sees a black man looking back. He briefly panics, feeling that he has lost his identity, and then he sets out to explore the black community."
Black Like MeJohn Howard Griffin,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/blacklikeme/summary.html,"Griffin expects to find prejudice, oppression, and hardship, but he is shocked at the extent of it: everywhere he goes, he experiences difficulties and insults. The word ""nigger"" seems to echo from every street corner. It is impossible to find a job, or even a restroom that blacks are allowed to use. Clerks refuse to cash his checks, and a white bully nearly attacks him before he chases the man away. After several traumatic days in New Orleans, Griffin decides to travel into the Deep South of Mississippi and Alabama, which are reputed to be even worse for blacks. (In Mississippi, a grand jury has just refused to indict a lynch mob that murdered a black man before he could stand trial.) In Mississippi, he is disheartened and exhausted, so he calls a white friend named P.D. East, a newspaperman who is ferociously opposed to racism. He spends a day with East, during which time they discuss the way racial prejudice has been incorporated into the South's legal code by bigoted writers and politicians. Eventually, a rejuvenated Griffin leaves for a long hitchhiking trip throughout Alabama and Mississippi."

John meets a group of Delta clones who are receiving their soma ration.
He tries to convince them to revolt, throwing the soma out
the window, and a riot results. Bernard and Helmholtz, hearing of
the riot, rush to the scene and come to John’s aid. After the riot
is calmed by police with soma vapor, John, Helmholtz,

Brave New World,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html,"The novel opens in
the Central London Hatching and Conditioning Centre, where the Director
of the Hatchery and one of his assistants, Henry Foster, are giving
a tour to a group of boys. The boys learn about the Bokanovsky and
Podsnap Processes that allow the Hatchery to produce thousands of
nearly identical human embryos. During the gestation period the
embryos travel in bottles along a conveyor belt through a factorylike
building, and are conditioned to belong to one of five castes: Alpha,
Beta, Gamma, Delta, or Epsilon. The Alpha embryos are destined to
become the leaders and thinkers of the World State. Each of the
succeeding castes is conditioned to be slightly less physically
and intellectually impressive. The Epsilons, stunted and stupefied
by oxygen deprivation and chemical treatments, are destined to perform
menial labor. Lenina Crowne, an employee at the factory, describes
to the boys how she vaccinates embryos destined for tropical climates."
Brave New World,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html,"While Lenina, disgusted with the Reservation, takes enough soma to
knock her out for eighteen hours, Bernard flies to Santa Fe where
he calls Mustapha Mond and receives permission to bring John and
Linda back to the World State. Meanwhile, John breaks into
the house where Lenina is lying intoxicated and unconscious, and barely
suppresses his desire to touch her. Bernard, Lenina, John, and Linda
fly to the World State, where the Director is waiting to exile Bernard
in front of his Alpha coworkers. But Bernard turns the tables by introducing
John and Linda. The shame of being a “father”—the very word makes
the onlookers laugh nervously—causes the Director to resign, leaving
Bernard free to remain in London."
Brave New World,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html,"After Bernard introduces them, John and Helmholtz quickly
take to each other. John reads Helmholtz parts of Romeo
and Juliet, but Helmholtz cannot keep himself from laughing
at a serious passage about love, marriage, and parents—ideas that
are ridiculous, almost scatological in World State culture."
Brave New World,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html,"John and Mond debate the value of the World State’s policies, John
arguing that they dehumanize the residents of the World State and
Mond arguing that stability and happiness are more important than
humanity. Mond explains that social stability has required the sacrifice
of art, science, and religion. John protests that, without these
things, human life is not worth living. Bernard reacts wildly when
Mond says that he and Helmholtz will be exiled to distant islands,
and he is carried from the room. Helmholtz accepts the exile readily,
thinking it will give him a chance to write, and soon follows Bernard
out of the room. John and Mond continue their conversation. They
discuss religion and the use of soma to control
negative emotions and social harmony."
Brave New World,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html,"John becomes a hit with London society because of his
strange life led on the Reservation. But while touring the factories
and schools of the World State, John becomes increasingly disturbed
by the society that he sees. His sexual attraction to Lenina remains,
but he desires more than simple lust, and he finds himself terribly
confused. In the process, he also confuses Lenina, who wonders why John
does not wish to have sex with her. As the discoverer and guardian
of the “Savage,” Bernard also becomes popular. He quickly takes
advantage of his new status, sleeping with many women and hosting
dinner parties with important guests, most of whom dislike Bernard
but are willing to placate him if it means they get to meet John. One
night John refuses to meet the guests, including the Arch-Community
Songster, and Bernard’s social standing plummets."

children engaged in sexual play and games like “Centrifugal Bumble-puppy.”
Mustapha Mond, one of the ten World Controllers, introduces himself
to the boys and begins to explain the history of the World State,
focusing on the State’s successful efforts to remove strong emotions,
desires, and human relationships from society. Meanwhile, inside
the Hatchery, Lenina chats in the bathroom with Fanny Crowne about
her relationship with Henry Foster. Fanny chides Lenina for going
out with Henry almost exclusively for four months, and Lenina admits
she is attracted to the strange, somewhat funny-looking Bernard Marx. In another part of the Hatchery, Bernard is enraged when he
overhears a conversation between Henry and the Assistant Predestinator
about “having” Lenina."
Brave New World,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/bravenew/summary.html,"John bids Helmholtz and Bernard good-bye. Refused the
option of following them to the islands by Mond, he retreats to
a lighthouse in the countryside where he gardens and attempts to
purify himself by self-flagellation. Curious World State citizens
soon catch him in the act, and reporters descend on the lighthouse
to film news reports and a feely. After the feely, hordes of people
descend on the lighthouse and demand that John whip himself. Lenina
comes and approaches John with her arms open. John reacts by brandishing
his whip and screaming “Kill it! Kill it!” The intensity of the
scene causes an orgy in which John takes part. The next morning
he wakes up and, overcome with anger and sadness at his submission
to World State society, hangs himself."

Bridge to TerabithiaKatherine Paterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/terabithia/summary.html,"One day the music teacher at school, Miss Edmunds, whom Jess has long had a crush on, invites him to spend a day with her touring the art galleries in Washington. This trip does much to expand his mind and make him feel as if he is special, a feeling he has previously only had in Leslie's company. Jess has a perfect day, but when he gets home he is told that Leslie drowned in the creek that morning trying to swing into Terabithia on the rope that they used for that purpose. Jess is completely devastated and goes through the stages of grief—denial, anger, fear, and sorrow—all incredibly painful to suffer and, indeed, to read about. Initially, he does not see how he is to go on initially. Leslie has raised him to new heights as the king of Terabithia, and now he feels that without her, he has no choice but to revert to the old Jess, plagued by fear and insecurity. However, eventually he realizes that he can only keep Leslie's memory, and his own newfound sense of self, alive by continuing the fantasy of Terabithia. He brings his little sister May Belle there and makes her its new queen, assuring that a part of Leslie will live on as well."
Bridge to TerabithiaKatherine Paterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/terabithia/summary.html,"A rather unpromising beginning, but Jess and Leslie become fast friends. They build a secret fantasyland across the creek in the woods, called Terabithia, where they play all the time. There they forget the rest of the world, such as the kids at school or Jess's less-than-satisfactory family. The time they spend in Terabithia, in fact, seems to strengthen them for these trials of everyday life: it is there that they map out a plan of revenge on the school bully when she steals May Belle's Twinkies, and it is there that they discuss Jess's feelings of insecurity when Leslie begins to draw closer to her father. Leslie also introduces Jess to the world of imagination and creativity, telling him the stories of such classics of literature as 
 Moby Dick
 and 
 Hamlet
 . All this also strengthens Jess's artistic talent and ability, as Leslie supports his ambition and, through the stories she tells, provides him with great subject matter. But much of the time they play wonderful games of their own invention—defeating intruders on Terabithian territory, praying to the Spirits of the Grove to end a long spell of rain, and numerous other fantasies."

He dreams of being the fastest boy in the fifth grade when school starts up in the fall, feeling that this will for once give him a chance to stand in the spotlight among his five sisters, and might win him the attention of his preoccupied father. Jess is quite insecure in his identity. He loves to paint and draw, but he knows very well that this labels him a ""sissy"" in the eyes of most of the world, particularly his father. In addition, his family is stretched so tight by poverty that he has little chance to really explore his own identity during this crucial period of adolescence. He has therefore built up the importance of winning in his mind, feeling that here, at least, is something that he is good at which won't win him an undesired label of ""sissy"" or ""girl"" in the eyes of his father or schoolmates, and which will allow him to shine in his own right. He practices each morning, always dreaming of his upcoming victory. However, when the races come around at recess, a new girl, Leslie Burke, who just moved next door to Jess, boldly crosses to the boys' side of the playground and beats everyone."

At home, they celebrate holidays together, such as Christmas, when Jess gives Leslie a puppy and she gives him an expensive art set to develop his artistic talent, and Easter, when Leslie goes to church for the first time with Jess. Leslie is impressed by the beauty of the story of Christ. Jess and his little sister May Belle, cowed by negative and unforgiving religious training, are convinced that nonbelievers such as Leslie are doomed to hell, and find the whole experience disturbing.

the land of Eldorado, where gold and jewels litter the streets.
This utopian country has advanced scientific knowledge, no religious conflict,
no court system, and places no value on its plentiful gold and jewels.
But Candide longs to return to Cunégonde, and after a month in Eldorado
he and Cacambo depart with countless invaluable jewels loaded onto
swift pack sheep. When they reach the territory of Surinam, Candide
sends Cacambo to Buenos Aires with instructions to use part of the
fortune to purchase Cunégonde from Don Fernando and then to meet
him in Venice. An unscrupulous merchant named Vanderdendur steals
much of Candide’s fortune, dampening his optimism somewhat. Frustrated,
Candide sails off to France with a specially chosen companion, an
unrepentantly pessimistic scholar named Martin. On the way there,
he recovers part of his fortune when a Spanish captain sinks Vanderdendur’s
ship. Candide takes this as proof that there is justice in the world,
but Martin staunchly disagrees."

Candide flees to territory controlled by Jesuits who are revolting
against the Spanish government. After demanding an audience with
a Jesuit commander, Candide discovers that the commander is Cunégonde’s
brother, the baron, who also managed to escape from the Bulgars.
Candide announces that he plans to marry Cunégonde, but the baron

When Bokonon and his friend McCabe first arrived on San Lorenzo, they wanted to make the island into a utopia. San Lorenzo had a tumultuous history, conquered and claimed by various nations at various times. The island was completely worthless. When McCabe and Bokonon asserted their authority, no one intervened. McCabe and Bokonon quickly realized that no amount of legal and economic reform would provide the island's residents with a good standard of living. Instead, Bokonon offered the inhabitants of the island comfort through the creation of an eponymous religion based on happy lies. At Bokonon's request, McCabe outlawed Bokononism and made its practice punishable by death. Thus, outlawed, the religion gave excitement and a comprehensible meaning to the lives of the island's impoverished masses. Every ruler since then, including, Papa Monzano, participated in the charade."

Asa praised Felix's ability to put his analytical, scientific mind to any task. Once, a general asked Felix to produce a solution to mud, a constant problem for troops on the move. Felix theorized the existence of an isotope of water, which he named ice-nine, that was solid at room temperature. Even the smallest seed of ice-nine dropped into a quagmire would solidify the mud and solve the problem. John, realizing that such an action could easily lead to the freezing of all water on earth, nervously asked if Felix had actually succeeded in creating ice-nine, a deadlier threat to life on earth than the atom bomb. Asa denied it, but he angrily ended the interview because he sensed that John thought scientists were cold-hearted and dangerous."

When John demanded that Frank, Newt, and Angela come to Monzano's bedroom, they confessed that they had divided Felix's awful creation among themselves after he died, though they couldn't explain why.

Catch-22Joseph Heller,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/catch22/summary.html,"Yossarian’s story forms the core of the novel, so most
events are refracted through his point of view. Yossarian takes
the whole war personally: unswayed by national ideals or abstract
principles, Yossarian is furious that his life is in constant danger
through no fault of his own. He has a strong desire to live and
is determined to be immortal or die trying. As a result, he spends
a great deal of his time in the hospital, faking various illnesses
in order to avoid the war. As the novel progresses through its loosely
connected series of recurring stories and anecdotes, Yossarian is
continually troubled by his memory of Snowden, a soldier who died
in his arms on a mission when Yossarian lost all desire to participate
in the war. Yossarian is placed in ridiculous, absurd, desperate,
and tragic circumstances—he sees friends die and disappear, his
squadron get bombed by its own mess officer, and colonels and generals
volunteer their men for the most perilous battle in order to enhance
their own reputations."
Catch-22Joseph Heller,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/catch22/summary.html,"As Yossarian struggles to stay alive, a number of secondary
stories unfold around him. His friend Nately falls in love with
a whore from Rome and woos her constantly, despite her continued
indifference and the fact that her kid sister constantly interferes
with their romantic rendezvous. Finally, she falls in love with
Nately, but he is killed on his very next mission. When Yossarian
brings her the bad news, she blames him for Nately’s death and tries
to stab him every time she sees him thereafter. Another subplot
follows the rise of the black-market empire of Milo Minderbinder,
the squadron’s mess hall officer. Milo runs a syndicate in which
he borrows military planes and pilots to transport food between
various points in Europe, making a massive profit from his sales.
Although he claims that “everyone has a share” in the syndicate,
this promise is later proven false. Milo’s enterprise flourishes
nonetheless, and he is revered almost religiously by communities
all over Europe."
Catch-22Joseph Heller,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/catch22/summary.html,"Catch-22 is a law defined in various
ways throughout the novel. First, Yossarian discovers that it is
possible to be discharged from military service because of insanity.
Always looking for a way out, Yossarian claims that he is insane,
only to find out that by claiming that he is insane he has proved
that he is obviously sane—since any sane person would claim that
he or she is insane in order to avoid flying bombing missions. Elsewhere,
Catch-22 is defined as a law that is illegal
to read. Ironically, the place where it is written that it is illegal
is in Catch-22 itself. It is yet again defined
as the law that the enemy is allowed to do anything that one can’t
keep him from doing. In short, then, Catch-22 is
any paradoxical, circular reasoning that catches its victim in its
illogic and serves those who have made the law. Catch-22 can
be found in the novel not only where it is explicitly defined but
also throughout the characters’ stories, which are full of catches
and instances of circular reasoning that trap unwitting bystanders
in their snares—for instance, the ability of the powerful officer
Milo Minderbinder to make great sums of money by trading among the
companies that he himself owns."
Catch-22Joseph Heller,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/catch22/summary.html,"During the second half of
World War II, a soldier named Yossarian is
stationed with his Air Force squadron on the island of Pianosa,
near the Italian coast in the Mediterranean Sea. Yossarian and his
friends endure a nightmarish, absurd existence defined by bureaucracy and
violence: they are inhuman resources in the eyes of their blindly ambitious
superior officers. The squadron is thrown thoughtlessly into brutal
combat situations and bombing runs in which it is more important
for the squadron members to capture good aerial photographs of explosions
than to destroy their targets. Their colonels continually raise
the number of missions that they are required to fly before being
sent home, so that no one is ever sent home. Still, no one but Yossarian
seems to realize that there is a war going on; everyone thinks he
is crazy when he insists that millions of people are trying to kill
him."
Catch-22Joseph Heller,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/catch22/summary.html,"The novel draws to a close as Yossarian, troubled by Nately’s death,
refuses to fly any more missions. He wanders the streets of Rome,
encountering every kind of human horror—rape, disease, murder. He
is eventually arrested for being in Rome without a pass, and his
superior officers, Colonel Cathcart and Colonel Korn, offer him
a choice. He can either face a court-martial or be released and sent
home with an honorable discharge. There is only one condition: in
order to be released, he must approve of Cathcart and Korn and state
his support for their policy, which requires all the men in the
squadron to fly eighty missions. Although he is tempted by the offer,
Yossarian realizes that to comply would be to endanger the lives
of other innocent men. He chooses another way out, deciding to desert
the army and flee to neutral Sweden. In doing so, he turns his back
on the dehumanizing machinery of the military, rejects the rule
of Catch-22, and strives to gain control
of his own life."

CeremonyLeslie Marmon Silko,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ceremony/summary.html,"The trauma of thinking he saw his uncle Josiah's face
among a crowd of Japanese soldiers he was ordered to shoot, and
then of watching his cousin Rocky die, drove Tayo out of his mind.
A period of time in a Veterans' Hospital gets him well enough to
return to his home, with his Grandmother, his Auntie, and her husband
Robert. This is the family unit that raised him after his mother,
who had conceived him with an unknown white man, left him for good
at the age of four. In his family's home Tayo faces not only their
disappointment at the loss of Rocky, but also his continued grieving
over his favorite uncle Josiah's death. He also contends with his
guilt over a prayer against the rain he uttered in the forests of
the Philippines, which he thinks is responsible for the six-year
drought on the reservation."
CeremonyLeslie Marmon Silko,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ceremony/summary.html,"Realizing that his ceremony has not been enough for Tayo, Ku'oosh
sends him to the nearby town of Gallup to see another medicine man,
Betonie, who knows more about the problems incurred by the contact
between Native American and white cultures. Although he is skeptical
of Betonie's strange ways and especially high connection with the
white world, Tayo tells him of his what is troubling him. Betonie
listens and explains that they must invent and complete a new ceremony.
Tayo accepts. Betonie tells Tayo stores of the old ceremonies as
he performs them. Then Betonie tells Tayo stories of his grandfather,
Descheeny, and the beginning of the creation of a new ceremony to
stop the destruction the whites, an invention of Native American
witchery, are wreaking on the world."
CeremonyLeslie Marmon Silko,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ceremony/summary.html,"Tayo is helped but not cured by Ku'oosh's ceremony. It
prompts him to consider his childhood, especially the summer before
he left for the army. Although Auntie did her best to keep the two
boys separate, Tayo and Rocky became close friends, and the summer
after they graduated from high school, they enlisted in the army
together. That summer, Josiah fell in love with Night Swan, a Mexican woman
who lived just outside the reservation. At her urging, he invested
in a herd of Mexican cattle, which Tayo helped him to care for.
As so often happens, there is a drought that summer. Having heard
the old stories of how droughts are ended, Tayo goes to a spring
and invents a rain ceremony. The following day it rains. In addition
to helping the crops and the cattle, the rain keeps Josiah from
visiting Night Swan. He asks Tayo to bring her a note. Tayo delivers
the note, and in the process is seduced by Night Swan."
CeremonyLeslie Marmon Silko,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ceremony/summary.html,"Following Ts'eh's instructions, Tayo easily evades the
white police. Still running from Emo, he meets Harley and Leroy.
Almost too late, Tayo realizes that Harley and Leroy have joined
forces with Emo. Running again, Tayo finds himself in an abandoned
uranium mine. As he looks at the gaping hole left in the earth,
Tayo realizes that this is the last station of his ceremony, the
one where he incorporates an element of white culture, the mine.
All he has to do is to spend the night there and the ceremony will
be complete. Soon Emo and Pinkie arrive. From a hiding place, Tayo
must watch them torture Harley to death, and restrain himself from
killing Emo in order to save Harley. With the help of the wind,
Tayo survives the night. He returns home and goes back to Ku'oosh.
After hearing all about Tayo's ceremony, Ku'oosh pronounces that
Ts'eh was in fact A'moo'ooh, who has given her blessings to Tayo
and his ceremony; the drought is ended and the destruction of the
whites is stopped. Tayo spends one last night in Ku'oosh's house
to finish off the ceremony, and then he returns home."
CeremonyLeslie Marmon Silko,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ceremony/summary.html,"Betonie sends Tayo back home, reminding him that the ceremony
is still far from complete. When he meets Harley and Leroy on the
way home, Tayo slips back into their lifestyle for a moment, but soon
moves on, heeding the signs Betonie told him of as he searches for
Josiah's cattle. Tayo follows the stars to a woman's house. After spending
a night with the woman, Ts'eh, Tayo heads up into the mountains.
He finds Josiah's cattle fenced into a white man's pasture. While
Tayo breaks into the pasture, the cattle run off to its far reaches,
and Tayo spends all night looking for them. As dawn approaches,
Tayo is about to give up when a mountain lion comes up to him. Tayo
honors the mountain lion, and follows its tracks to the cattle.
Just as he herds the cattle out of the pasture, two white patrolmen
find Tayo. Not realizing that the cattle are missing, but knowing
Tayo has trespassed, the patrolmen arrest Tayo. Before they can
bring him to town, however, they notice the mountain lion tracks
and let Tayo go in order to hunt it. As Tayo heads out, it begins
to snow. Tayo knows this will cover the tracks of his cattle and
of the mountain lion, making the patrolmens' efforts fruitless. On
the way down the mountain, Tayo meets a hunter, who lives with Ts'eh.
When they arrive back at her house, she has corralled Tayo's cattle,
which she keeps until Tayo and Robert return with a cattle truck
to gather them up."
CeremonyLeslie Marmon Silko,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ceremony/summary.html,"Returning home with Josiah's cattle, Tayo feels cured.
However, the drought persists, and Tayo knows the ceremony is not
complete. He goes to the family's ranch with the cattle, where he
finds Ts'eh . They spend the summer together, but as it draws to
an end Robert visits and warns Tayo that Emo has been spreading
rumors about him. Shortly thereafter, Ts'eh tells Tayo that Emo
and the white police are coming after him. Before she leaves, she
tells Tayo how to avoid capture."
CeremonyLeslie Marmon Silko,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ceremony/summary.html,"As he slowly recuperates, Tayo realizes that he is not
alone. His childhood friends Harley, Leroy, Emo, and Pinkie who
also fought in the war contend with similar post-traumatic stress,
self-medicating with alcohol. The company is little comfort. His
old friends spend their drunken hours reminiscing about how great
the war was and how much respect they got while they were in uniform.
These stories only make Tayo think about the tremendous discrimination the
Native Americans face at the hands of the whites, whom they nonetheless
seem to admire, and he is even more saddened and infuriated. Just
as Tayo begins to give up hope and to wish he could return to the
VA hospital, his grandmother calls in the medicine man, Ku'oosh.
Ku'oosh performs for Tayo a ceremony for warriors who have killed
in battle, but both Ku'oosh and Tayo fear that the ancient ceremonies
are not applicable to this new situation."

Child of the DarkCarolina Maria de Jesus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/childofthedark/summary.html,"Child of the Dark, the diary of Carolina Maria de
Jesus, covers the period between July 1955 and January 1, 1960, with a gap, due to
editing, between 1955 and 1958. Carolina has three children: Vera (two), José Carlos
(five), and João (eight). They live in a favela, or shantytown, where living spaces
consist of crude huts built of cardboard and wood scraps. Her daily life consists of
collecting paper and metal scraps for food money. While looking for scraps outside a
football stadium, Carolina endures taunts from white patrons. Carolina often fares
no better closer to home—meddlesome favela woman like Dona Rosa and Dona Silvia pick
fights with Carolina’s children and try to provoke Carolina. Favela life is full of hunger, disease, violence, and alcoholism. Carolina’s
only consolation is writing and the occasional kindness of friends and strangers,
such as when a man stops by the favela and gives Carolina’s daughter, Vera, one
hundred cruzieros, the equivalent of what Carolina often earns in a day."
Child of the DarkCarolina Maria de Jesus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/childofthedark/summary.html,"Carolina refuses to put her interest in marrying before her interest in her
children, even when she is proposed to by a man named Manuel, who, compared to the
other favelados, is fairly well off, a worker and abstainer from
alcohol. Against her own better judgment, Carolina also becomes intertwined with a
gypsy named Raimundo, who awakens in her a sense of romance and adventure.
Ultimately, she decides that he is not the man she thought he was, but when he moves
away, she is sick and broken-hearted. Through both entanglements, Carolina maintains
that she is not the marrying type, her children come first, and she is unwilling to
make the sacrifices that she sees other women making in order to get
married."
Child of the DarkCarolina Maria de Jesus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/childofthedark/summary.html,"Carolina takes every opportunity she can get to participate in Brazil’s
political system, but after going to Congress to observe her leaders, she feels
nothing but disgust. In response to the ignorance she sees from those in power,
Carolina levels many critiques against the political system that she believes
contributes to the poverty and hunger of the favelados. To
Carolina, Brazil’s President Juscelino is a bird in a cage, and the favela dwellers
are hungry cats that may someday rise up against him if given the chance. On a more
day-to-day level, Carolina senses that she lives in a system that conspires against
the poor. Inflation is rampant, and prices for basic necessities, such as rice and
flour, can be absurd. When Carolina watches a factory owner dump rotted food near
the favela, she considers it an act of blatant cruelty. Carolina also endures racial
and class discrimination every time she ventures out of the favela and into the city of São Paulo. While taking a streetcar, Carolina
discusses the politician Dr. Adhemar with other passengers, who blame him for the
steep increases in the cost of transportation. Carolina thinks that Adehemar is
angry and wants to punish the poor. In the often-brutal world she lives in, Carolina
wonders how much worse conditions can get."
Child of the DarkCarolina Maria de Jesus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/childofthedark/summary.html,"The intervention of a journalist named Audalio Dantas helps Carolina to
realize her dream of being published. When excerpts of her diary appear in a weekly
magazine called O Cruziero, Carolina tells
everyone she can about her new fame. Unfortunately, being published does not have
the effect that she was hoping for. Not only do Carolina’s dire daily circumstances
remain unchanged, but she quickly finds success to be a bitter pill when the favela
fills with disparaging talk of her motives. Even after her publication, Carolina
must deal with the same challenges and frustrations: the struggle to scrape together
enough money for food, the lines at the water spigot, the fights, and the racism and
sexism she faces on a daily basis. Despite these daily humiliations, Carolina holds
fast to her dream of finding a home far from the favela for her family."
Child of the DarkCarolina Maria de Jesus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/childofthedark/summary.html,"Carolina struggles to insulate her children from bad influences, but she
receives several summons from the police station regarding her boys’ behavior. After
a few visits there, and after a neighbor woman, Chica, levels an accusation of rape
against João, Carolina briefly considers interning her children in a public shelter
for their own safety and wellbeing. Carolina believes that João’s accuser is lying,
but she worries that her children are in danger while the matter is being
investigated. After two runaways from the shelter seek refuge in Carolina’s home,
and she hears their stories of horrible abuse, she changes her mind about putting
her children there, recognizing that the experience would likely turn them into
criminals. The fact that the favela changes everyone it touches is
a reality that Carolina fully understands. As she observes a new resident become
increasingly argumentative and desperate as they adapt to the “dog-eat-dog”
mentality that rules the favela, Carolina recognizes that a person can resist being
dragged down by it only for so long."

Chronicle of a Death ForetoldGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/chrondeath/summary.html,"The day that Santiago is murdered was a significant day in town because the Bishop was coming by boat to bless the marriage of Angela Vicario and Bayardo San Roman. Many people were heading over to the dock to see the boats. Pedro and Pablo Vicario were sitting in the local milk-shop, which was en route to the dock, so that they could see Santiago Nasar either going or returning in order to track him down and kill him. The narrator's sister learns that Angela Vicario was returned home on the night of her wedding."
Chronicle of a Death ForetoldGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/chrondeath/summary.html,"After the murder, the entire Vicario family left town because of the disgrace the combination of events had brought upon their family. A week after the murder, Bayardo San Roman left with his family; they came and retrieved him by boat. The Vicario brothers were imprisoned for three years. After their release from prison, Pablo proceeded to marry his betrothed, Prudencia Cotes, and Pedro went back into the armed forces."
Chronicle of a Death ForetoldGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/chrondeath/summary.html,"The night before the murder, there had been lots of wedding revelry that had continued into the early morning at a local whorehouse run by Maria Alejandrina Cervantes, where Santiago Nasar had been carousing with the twins and the narrator until early in the morning. After returning home and finding their sister in disgrace, the Vicario brothers set out to avenge her honor by murdering Santiago Nasar. Even though they repeatedly announced their intent to murder him, the butcher, the police officer, and the Colonel all thought that the Vicarios are largely bluffing. Clothilde Armenta, the proprietor of the milk shop, even told the local priest about what the Vicario twins were threatening to do. However, in the excitement surrounding the arrival of the bishop, he forgot about her warning."
Chronicle of a Death ForetoldGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/chrondeath/summary.html,"For years after the crime, it was all anyone in the town spoke of. The narrator tells how his friend Cristo Bedoya searched frantically for Santiago the morning of the murder in order to warn him of the Vicario brothers' plan, but failed to find Santiago because he did not realize that Santiago had gone to the house of his fiance, Flora Miguel. Her father was the first to warn Santiago of the murder. At this point, there were crowds of people outside who had come to see the Bishop but had lingered because they had heard the rumor that Santiago was to be killed."
Chronicle of a Death ForetoldGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/chrondeath/summary.html,"The narrative is non-linear. The narrator begins the story by telling us about Santiago Nasar's household the morning he was murdered. In the course of the chapter, we learn that Santiago lived with his mother, Placida Linero; their cook, Victoria Guzman; and her daughter, Divina Flor. Santiago's father, Ibrahim Nasar, has died three years previously. After his father died, Santiago took over the family ranch, which has been very successful; the Nasars are wealthy in their community."
Chronicle of a Death ForetoldGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/chrondeath/summary.html,"Bayardo San Roman had come to town to find a bride. After deciding on Angela, the courtship was short. Because Bayardo came from a prestigious, wealthy family, and the Vicarios were relatively poor, Angela did not really have a choice, even though she did not love Bayardo at the time they were wed."
ClarissaSamuel Richardson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/clarissa/summary.html,"Once Clarissa has run away, she is in Lovelace’s power.
Her reputation is ruined and her family refuses to forgive her.
Lovelace is an adept manipulator, enjoying the “contrivances” he
invents to keep Clarissa in his web. He is in love with her, but
he hates the idea of marriage, so his goal is to force her into
“cohabitation,” rather than marriage. Clarissa is innocent and virtuous
and does not see through Lovelace’s tricks. Furthermore, she refuses
to compromise any of her strict tenets of behavior, even to save
herself. Lovelace repeatedly tests Clarissa’s virtue as a means
of testing the character of the entire sex: if Clarissa is truly
an exemplary woman, she will withstand his contrivances and remain
a model of goodness. His intention, however, is to force Clarissa
to compromise her strict morals, sully her reputation, and gain
full control over her. Without suspecting that she is playing into
his hands, she goes with him to London, where he secures lodgings
at Mrs. Sinclair’s house. Clarissa is unaware that this is a brothel
and the women she meets there are whores. Having been involved with
(and ruined by) Lovelace in the past, these women are jealous of
Clarissa and encourage Lovelace to rape her."
ClarissaSamuel Richardson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/clarissa/summary.html,"Clarissa tells the story of a virtuous,
beautiful young woman who is brought to tragedy by the wickedness
of her world. The eighteen-year-old Clarissa Harlowe is universally
loved and admired, considered an exemplary woman by everyone around
her. The Harlowes are an up-and-coming family, possessing great
wealth but little status. The other members of the family are avaricious
and eager to improve their standing in the world, and Clarissa becomes
the victim of their greed. The trouble starts when Richard Lovelace,
a dashing libertine, comes to pay court to Clarissa’s sister, Arabella, but
is attracted by Clarissa instead. Arabella’s jealousy combines with
the resentment of their brother, James, who holds a grudge against
Lovelace from college days, and sets the family against him."
ClarissaSamuel Richardson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/clarissa/summary.html,"A duel between the two, in which Lovelace wounds James
but spares his life, crystallizes their hatred. The family becomes
suspicious of Clarissa, forbids her from corresponding with Lovelace, and
commands her to marry a horrible rich man named Roger Solmes. Clarissa
refuses to consider marrying Solmes and carries on a clandestine
correspondence with Lovelace. She also continues to secretly correspond
with her best friend, Anna Howe. As she continues to resist marriage
to Solmes, Clarissa is increasingly confined, until she is barely
able to leave her room. Finally Lovelace takes advantage of Clarissa’s
fear of a forced marriage by tricking her into running away with
him."
ClarissaSamuel Richardson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/clarissa/summary.html,"With remarkable equanimity, Clarissa makes her will, appoints Belford
her executor, puts her affairs in order, and even orders a coffin. She
finally dies, expressing forgiveness for everyone in her life and joyful
anticipation of heaven. The Harlowes finally see how wrong their
treatment of Clarissa has been. Mr. and Mrs. Harlowe die soon after,
and James and Arabella marry badly and are miserable for the rest
of their lives. Lovelace fails to reform and is killed by Clarissa’s cousin
Morden in a duel. Anna, Hickman, Belford, and the other good characters
are rewarded with happy marriages. Belford takes on the project
of collecting the letters that tell Clarissa’s story so that it
can be an example to protect other women from similar fates."
ClarissaSamuel Richardson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/clarissa/summary.html,"Once Clarissa has been raped, she stops eating and no
longer worries about worldly problems like reputation. She continues
to seek reconciliation with her family, but they remain adamant.
One of Lovelace’s plots gone wrong allows him to accidentally discover Clarissa’s
location, but at the same time it damages her health and cements
her conviction of his wickedness. Lovelace’s friend Belford becomes
Clarissa’s protector, keeping Lovelace away but mediating between
him and Clarissa. Lovelace is now truly determined to marry Clarissa,
but she prefers the idea of death to that of marrying such a criminal.
Her health steadily worsens, and she begins to prepare for death."
ClarissaSamuel Richardson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/clarissa/summary.html,"At the same time, Clarissa’s virtue has a powerful effect
on Lovelace and sometimes sways him away from his bad intentions.
After several battles between his wicked heart and his protesting
conscience, Lovelace’s joy in intrigue and the whores’ instigations
seal Clarissa’s doom. Finally suspecting Lovelace’s vileness, Clarissa escapes,
but Lovelace finds her and tricks her back to Mrs. Sinclair’s brothel.
There, Mrs. Sinclair drugs Clarissa and Lovelace rapes her while
she is unconscious. When she awakes, Clarissa goes temporarily mad,
and Lovelace regrets his action. The rape has failed to put Clarissa
fully in his power because she has never compromised her virtue.
He begins to talk with more seriousness about marrying her, but
also thinks he will try to rape her again and see if he can get her
consent, thus abandoning her principles. Clarissa, sensing the danger,
runs away, this time successfully."

Coming of Age in MississippiAnne Moody,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/comingofage/summary.html,"Meanwhile, Anne has begun to attract the attention of the boys in her high
school and the men in her community. When she outgrows her school dresses, she wears
jeans, which she cannot afford to replace even when they grow tight. She becomes so
popular with the boys that she is elected homecoming queen. Diddly even provides
Anne with a beautiful gown, making the homecoming parade one of the few joyful
moments of her young life. When Anne is still very young, her mother develops a
romantic relationship with Raymond Davis, with whom she has four more children.
Raymond’s family, especially Miss Pearl, Raymond’s mother, looks down on Toosweet
because she has darker skin than they do. Yet Anne enjoys their new home in
Centreville, and especially Centreville Baptist Church, the upscale church Raymond’s
family attends. When Anne’s mother wants her to attend their old, poorer church,
Anne gets into the first of many serious conflicts with her mother."
Coming of Age in MississippiAnne Moody,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/comingofage/summary.html,"When Anne first hears about the NAACP (the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People), a forbidden organization in rural Mississippi, she
begins to contemplate how the racial inequalities around her can be overthrown.
Meanwhile, however, her own struggles with her family are more pressing. Toosweet
feels that Anne is starting to look down on her, especially when Anne changes her
name from Essie Mae to Annie Mae because she thinks Essie Mae sounds like a name for
barnyard animals. Anne’s family does not understand Anne’s growing interest in the
civil rights movement; in fact, they are afraid of it. Anne spends her last three
summers of high school in Baton Rouge and New Orleans, doing menial jobs for more
money than she could earn at home. Eventually, Anne can no longer stand the family,
especially Raymond, and she storms out and moves in with her father, Diddly, and his
wife, Emma. Emma and her family are light skinned, but do not hold themselves above
anyone, and Anne grows close to them."
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,"Paine begins by distinguishing between government and society. Society, according to Paine, is everything constructive and good that people join together to accomplish. Government, on the other hand, is an institution whose sole purpose is to protect us from our own vices. Government has its origins in the evil of man and is therefore a necessary evil at best. Paine says that government's sole purpose is to protect life, liberty and property, and that a government should be judged solely on the basis of the extent to which it accomplishes this goal."
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,"In Common Sense, Thomas Paine argues for American independence. His argument begins with more general, theoretical reflections about government and religion, then progresses onto the specifics of the colonial situation."
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,"Paine says that as a colony of Britain, America lacks respectability on the international scene. They are seen simply as rebels, and cannot form substantial alliances with other nations. In order to prosper in the long term, the colonies need to be independent. Paine says that, by declaring independence, America will be able to ask for the help of other countries in its struggle for freedom. For all of these reasons, Paine says it is imperative and urgent that the colonies declare independence."
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,"Having dispensed with the preliminary theoretical issues, Paine sets in to discuss the details of the American situation. In response to the argument that America has flourished under British rule, and therefore ought to stay under the king, Paine says that such an argument fails to realize that America has evolved and no longer needs Britain's help. Some say that Britain has protected America, and therefore deserves allegiance, but Paine responds that Britain has only watched over America in order to secure its own economic well-being. Paine adds that most recently, instead of watching over the colonies, the British have been attacking them, and are therefore undeserving of American loyalty."
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,Paine even proposes the form of government that the independent colonies should adopt. His recommendation is for a representative democracy that gives roughly equal weight to each of the colonies.
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,"Paine says that the colonies have little to gain from remaining attached to Britain. Commerce can be better conducted with the rest of Europe, but only after America becomes independent. Paine also asserts that if the colonies remain attached to Britain, the same problems that have arisen in the past will arise in the future. Paine argues that it is necessary to seek independence now, as to do otherwise would only briefly cover up problems that will surely reemerge."
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,"Paine explains why the current time is a good time to break free of Britain. Primarily, Paine focuses on the present size of the colonies, and on their current capabilities. He presents an inventory of the British Navy and gives calculations revealing how America could build a navy of comparable size. Paine recommends this as a way of ensuring America's security and prosperity in trade. Paine also argues that America is sufficiently small as to be united now. If time were to elapse, and the population of the colonies to grow, the same feeling of unity would not be present. Paine adds that if the Americans revolt now, they can use the vast expanses of uncharted land to the West in order to pay down some of the debt they will incur."
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,"Paine then considers an imagined scenario in which a small group of people has been placed on an island, and cut off from the rest of society. In time, these people develop ties with one another, and lawmaking becomes inevitable. Paine says the people will be much happier if they are responsible for the creation of the laws that rule them. Paine is also implicitly arguing that such a system of representation is also better for the American colonists. Having expressed his disagreement with British reign in America, Paine proceeds to launch a general attack on the British system of government. Paine says the British system is too complex and rife with contradictions, and that the monarchy is granted far too much power. The British system pretends to offer a reasonable system of checks and balances, but in fact, it does not."
Common SenseThomas Paine,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/commonsense/summary.html,"From here Paine moves on to discuss, in general, the notions of monarchy and hereditary succession. Man, Pain argues, was born into a state of equality, and the distinction that has arisen between king and subject is an unnatural one. At first, Paine says, the world was without kings, but the ancient Jews decided they wanted a king. This angered God, but he allowed them to have one. Paine presents pages of biblical evidence detailing God's wrath at the idea of the Jews having a king. The conclusion Paine reaches is that the practice of monarchy originates from sin, and is an institution that the Bible and God condemn. Paine calls hereditary succession an abominable practice. He says that even if people were to choose to have a king, that does not legitimize that King's child acting as a future ruler. Furthermore, hereditary succession has brought with it innumerable evils, such as incompetent kings, corruption, and civil war."

He sits in a green armchair with his back to the door. He likes the feeling of giving himself over to the story while simultaneously enjoying the presence of his cigarettes, his armchair, and the view of the park from his window. He sinks into the novel, in which a man and woman meet in a cabin. The woman kisses the man’s face where a tree branch has scratched it, making it bleed. The man and woman are lovers, but their attention is now focused on murder: the man is going to kill the woman’s husband. They leave the cabin and split up. The woman goes north, and he goes to her house. Following her instructions, knife in hand, the man goes inside and sees his victim: a man who’s sitting in an armchair reading a book."

In order to gain this office, however, he must go out and plead for the votes of the plebeians, a task that he undertakes reluctantly. At first, the common people agree to give him their votes, but they later reverse their decision at the prodding of two clever tribunes, Brutus and Sicinius, who consider Coriolanus an enemy of the people. This drives the proud Coriolanus into a fury, and he speaks out intemperately against the very idea of popular rule; Brutus and Sicinius, seizing on his words, declare him a traitor to the Roman state and drive him into exile."
CoriolanusWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/coriolanus/summary.html,"In ancient Rome, in the aftermath of a famine, the common people, or plebeians, demand the right to set their own price for the city's grain supply. In response to their protests, the ruling aristocracy, or patricians, grant the plebeians five representatives, or tribunes--a decision that provokes the ire of the proud patrician soldier Caius Martius, who has nothing but contempt for the lower classes. At this time, war breaks out with a neighboring Italian tribe, the Volscians, who are led by Martius' great rival, Tullus Aufidius. In the campaign that follows, the Volscians are defeated, and the Rome takes the Italian city of Corioles, thanks to the heroism of Martius. In recognition of his great deeds, he is granted the name Coriolanus."

Aufidius is planning a new campaign against the Romans, and he welcomes Coriolanus's assistance, although he soon feels himself to be falling into his new ally's shadow. Their army proceeds to march on Rome, throwing the city into a panic--Rome's armies are helpless to stop the advance, and soon Aufidius and Coriolanus are encamped outside the city walls. Two of his oldest friends come pleading for mercy, but Coriolanus refuses to hear him. However, when his mother, Volumnia, to whom he is devoted, begs him to make peace, he relents, and the Romans hail Volumnia the savior of the city. Meanwhile, Coriolanus and the Volscians return to Antium, where the residents hail Coriolanus as a hero. Aufidius, feeling slighted, declares that Coriolanus's failure to take Rome amounts to treachery; in the ensuing argument, some of Aufidius' men assassinate Coriolanus."

upset by his meeting with Roxane. When the cadets arrive, Christian
tries to prove his courage by insulting Cyrano’s nose—an act generally
considered fatal. Instead of killing Christian, however, Cyrano
embraces him and tells him about Roxane’s feelings. Delighted at
first, Christian then becomes distraught. He considers Roxane an
intellectual and sees himself as a simple, unpoetic man. Then Cyrano
has a bright idea: Cyrano can write to Roxane -pretending to be
Christian. Christian agrees, welcoming the opportunity to reach
Roxane’s heart. Now, Cyrano can express all his thoughts and feelings
secretly."
Cyrano de BergeracEdmond Rostand,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cyrano/summary.html,"As night falls, Cyrano asks to read Christian’s last letter
to her. He reads it, and when it is completely dark, he continues
to read, as if he knows the letter by heart. Roxane realizes that
Cyrano wrote the letters—she has found the soul she was in love
with all along. Upset, Ragueneau and Le Bret rush in, proclaiming
that Cyrano has killed himself by getting out of bed. Cyrano removes
his hat, revealing his heavily bandaged head. Roxane exclaims that
she loves him and that he cannot die. But Cyrano draws his sword
and engages in one last fight with his “old enemies”—falsehood,
prejudice, and compromise—slashing at the air insensibly. Then he
collapses and dies, smiling as Roxane bends over him and kisses
his face."
Cyrano de BergeracEdmond Rostand,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cyrano/summary.html,"When Montfleury takes the stage, Cyrano bullies him off
it. A group of aristocrats tries to send Cyrano away, but he challenges them
all to a duel. He fights Valvert, a Vicomte whom the Comte de Guiche
has selected as a husband for Roxane. As he fights, Cyrano improvises
a poem about the duel. Then, upon speaking his last line, Cyrano
thrusts his sword home. His victory causes a sensation, and Roxane’s
duenna brings him a message from her mistress, asking him to meet
her in the morning. As he agrees, he learns that Ligniere has offended
a powerful nobleman with his latest satire and that a hundred men
are waiting to ambush him on his way home. Cyrano boldly proclaims
that he will see Ligniere safely home and, if necessary, fight all
hundred men in the process."
Cyrano de BergeracEdmond Rostand,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cyrano/summary.html,"One night soon after, Roxane confides in Cyrano that
she thinks Christian is the most ravishing poet in the world. Cyrano’s
disguised letters have moved her inexpressibly. Christian tells
Cyrano he no longer wants Cyrano’s help, and then makes a fool of
himself trying to speak seductively to Roxane. Roxane storms into
her house, confused and angry. Thinking quickly, Cyrano makes Christian
stand in front of Roxane’s balcony and speak to her while Cyrano
stands under the balcony whispering to Christian what to say. Eventually, Cyrano
shoves Christian aside and, under cover of darkness, pretends to
be Christian, wooing Roxane himself. In the process, he wins a kiss
for Christian. Roxane and Christian are secretly married by a Capuchin,
but their happiness is short-lived: de Guiche, angry to have lost
Roxane, declares that he is sending the Cadets of Gascoyne to the
front lines of the war with Spain."

brilliant poet and swordsman named Cyrano de Bergerac finds himself
deeply in love with his beautiful, intellectual cousin Roxane. Despite
Cyrano’s brilliance and charisma, a shockingly large nose afflicts
his appearance, and he considers himself too ugly even to risk telling Roxane
his feelings. One night, Cyrano goes to the playhouse at the Hotel
de Bourgogne to make trouble: he has forbidden the actor Montfleury
to take the stage for one month, but Montfleury plans to perform
in the night’s production of La Clorise, with Roxane
in the audience. Also in the audience is a young, handsome nobleman
named Christian, who confides in his friend Ligniere that he loves
Roxane."

The summer had become too much for Douglas, but the air helps him see that change is a part of life and restores the magic to the summer. Douglas is able to come to terms with his death.

Rather than encourage the Vicomte de Valmont to meet the conditions of their original agreement, she mocks him for having fallen in love with the Présidente de Tourvel. Valmont's pride does not withstand these attacks very well, and to avoid compromising his reputation as a good-for-nothing gigolo, he leaves the Présidente cold, with no explanation. Cécile fares no better, after a particularly rough night in Valmont's room, she miscarries his child."
Dangerous LiaisonsPierre Ambroise Laclos,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/dangerous/summary.html,"In a pair of sumptuous drawingrooms, one in a Parisian mansion, the other in a chateau on a luxurious estate in the countryside surrounding Paris, two aristocrats are very bored. The Marquise de Merteuil decides, therefore, to construct a little intrigue for her own amusement and the amusement of her former lover, the Vicomte de Valmont. The Marquise is aware that a young girl of good family, Cécile Volanges, has only just left the convent so that she can be married to the Comte de Gercourt. Now, the Marquise has a bone to pick with this particular Comte, and so she suggests to the Vicomte that he seduce and debauch Cécile to create a scandal and humiliate Gercourt. Valmont accepts the Marquise's proposal somewhat coolly, since he already has his eyes on another prey, the highly religious Présidente de Tourvel, the chaste wife of a member of Parliament. But, never one to refuse a challenge, Valmont suggests that he and the Marquise enter into a slightly different bet: if he can obtain written proof that he has slept with the Présidente, the Marquise must yield herself to him."

He has very little luck in this department despite his use of every known trick in the book. Then, as coincidence would have, Cécile's mother, Madame Volanges, who corresponds regularly with the Présidente de Tourvel, happens to say some rather unflattering things about Valmont in a letter which Valmont just happens to steal and read.

Valmont hands over his correspondence with the Marquise to Danceny on his deathbed; all of society learns of her schemes and machinations.

He exhibits the first of a series of short-term amnesia attacks on Feb. 19. Johnny wants to get off the Gerson diet and return to Deerfield, but both requests are denied. He works hard to make up his schoolwork in preparation for Harvard, and he enrolls and excels in a tutoring school. On April 12, he takes his college boards. Gunther finishes the book he was writing, and he takes Johnny to Neurological Hospital for an exam. Mount takes some fluid as a sample but is only able to extract very little from the stone-sized, rigid structure. Gunther is told Johnny has glioma multiforme, one of the worst forms of tumor, and it is rapidly worsening. Penfield urges Gunther to have him undergo a drastic second operation to try and clear out the tumor. They decide to take him off the Gerson diet. On May 1, Mount extracts ""two handfuls"" from the tumor, but the tumor is still huge."
Death Be Not ProudJohn Gunther,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/deathbenot/summary.html,"Johnny returns home for Spring break and has a good time. The family doctor, Traeger, says that he's fine. However, he does have a slightly stiff neck. At school, they believe Johnny has a brain tumor, so they bring in a specialist, Tracy Putnam. Gunther and Frances drive to Deerfield, and when Gunther sees the face of one of the doctors, he immediately knows that Johnny will die. Johnny endures a painful spinal tap and is sent by ambulance to Columbia- Presbyterian Hospital in New York. He manages to stay upbeat and intellectual about his worsening condition. He has his first operation on April 29, which takes six hours. Johnny's tumor is in a difficult spot for extrication. The operation removes half of the orange-sized tumor. Johnny makes a fast recovery, and he is walking within two weeks and exhibiting his normal curious intellect. On May 28, Johnny faints and gets worse. Gunther finds out the tumor is undergoing glioblastomatous transformation, a far worse condition that carries the possibilities of blindness, paralysis, and the inevitability of death."
Death Be Not ProudJohn Gunther,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/deathbenot/summary.html,"Gunther transcribes the letters Johnny wrote in his life from age seven until near his death. Johnny's early letters display his sensitive, loving side, and his fascination with science and a variety of hobbies that he would take with him throughout his life. His last letter, to Frances, includes a scribbled note: ""Scientists will save us all."""
Death Be Not ProudJohn Gunther,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/deathbenot/summary.html,"Johnny is discharged from the hospital on June 1, but he continues going every day for x-rays until June 20, when he returns home to Connecticut. His physical activity is restricted, but he busies himself with his science workshop in the garage and with visits from friends and relatives. Johnny develops papilledema, a protrusion that damages the optic nerve and loses a great deal of peripheral vision. The bump on his head opens and leaks pus. He is taken to Wilder Penfield, a renowned surgeon. Penfield tells Gunther that the tumor will kill Johnny. Frances reads a newspaper article about how an experimental method of intravenous dosages of mustard gas, which is commonly poisonous, can improve tumors. Memorial Hospital in New York administers its first injection of mustard gas to Johnny. The mustard produces bad side effects, but it helps Johnny at first. He returns to the country and devotes himself to making up his lost schoolwork and other activities. On August 31, another leak develops. Gunther learns of Max Gerson, a doctor whose unorthodox methods of treating illnesses are based on a controversial diet. With nothing to lose, he and Frances decide to put Johnny on the diet. On September 7, they drive to Gerson's nursing home."
Death Be Not ProudJohn Gunther,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/deathbenot/summary.html,"Gunther also transcribes a diary that Johnny kept over the last few years; Johnny took the notebook with him wherever he was while sick. Since Johnny left the diary conspicuously in the open, Gunther and Frances believed he was using it indirectly to communicate to them thoughts he did not want to discuss. One entry lists the five-part ""Gunther philosophy,"" which includes rules and reminders like the Confucian Golden Rule (do unto others as they would do unto you) and ""No immortality."" His post-tumor entries rarely touch upon his condition, but they continue with philosophical ruminations and directions, academic reports, and day-to-day news, though he occasionally exposes his fears and turbulent emotions."
Death Be Not ProudJohn Gunther,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/deathbenot/summary.html,"At Gerson's nursing home, Johnny starts feeling better. Traeger agrees to continue with Gerson's methods, which include rest, daily enemas, and a salt- free, fat-free diet. Johnny gets much better, and Gunther is confident that he will fully recover. Frances keeps Johnny in high spirits, reading to him and bringing gifts. Johnny's bump worsens, and he develops a second bump. When Gunther tells him he cannot return to school, he furiously makes up his lost time through tutoring. He writes a letter to his headmaster, asking for a reprieve from his unfinished work and another letter to his math teacher, asking to take an important algebra exam. Johnny worsens, though his doctors are amazed that he is still alive. They fight about whether he should undergo more drainage. Gunther and Frances decide on a compromise, which includes surgery while keeping with the Gerson diet. Johnny heads off to the Neurological Hospital for five weeks. Dr. Mount makes a highly successful emergency drainage. Johnny's recovery is strengthened, the bump disappears, and everyone believes he will be back to normal within a year, especially when they find out the pus from his bump was sterile, indicating that the tumor is dead. He returns home on February 6 for the first time since August."
Death Be Not ProudJohn Gunther,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/deathbenot/summary.html,"Frances narrates the final section. She brings up all the questions about life that death raises, which she says she discussed with Johnny throughout his illness; to her, he was not merely dying, he was re-born each day. The only answer she can muster to all the philosophical questions is that she wishes they had loved Johnny more. She wants to tell other parents to embrace their children, who are alive, not dead. She resolves again that the aim of life is to love, to eradicate hate, and that she hopes to love Johnny more and more until she dies—as that kind of love is a ""love of love, the love of life."""
Death Be Not ProudJohn Gunther,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/deathbenot/summary.html,"John Gunther (hereafter referred to as Gunther) writes that this memoir is about death and what his son Johnny courageously endured, in an effort to provide hope to others who have to deal with similar pain. Gunther briefly sketches Johnny's life: he lived in Vienna and London when he was young; attended Deerfield Academy in Massachusetts; and died in 1947 at the age of seventeen, after a fifteen-month-long illness. He describes Johnny's adolescent but handsome appearance, his amiable nature, his tremendous willpower, and, above all, his selflessness. He notes Johnny's varied interests, his incredible intelligence, and his passion for science. He also mentions his ex-wife, Frances, with whom Johnny is very close."
Death in VeniceThomas Mann,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/venice/summary.html,"Gustav von Aschenbach is an aging German writer who is the paragon of solemn dignity and fastidious self-discipline. Determinedly cerebral and duty-bound, he believes that true art is produced only in ""defiant despite"" of corrupting passions and physical weaknesses."
Death in VeniceThomas Mann,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/venice/summary.html,"When Aschenbach has the urge to travel, he tells himself that he might find artistic inspiration from a change of scene. Aschenbach's subsequent trip to Venice is the first indulgence he has allowed himself in years; it signals the beginning of his decline. Aschenbach allows the languid Venetian atmosphere and gently rocking gondolas to lull him into a defenseless state. At his hotel he notices an extremely beautiful fourteen-year-old Polish boy named Tadzio, who is visiting with his mother, sisters, and governess. At first, Aschenbach's interest in the boy is purely aesthetic, or so he tells himself. However, he soon falls deeply and obsessively in love with the boy, although the two never have direct contact."
Death in VeniceThomas Mann,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/venice/summary.html,"Aschenbach spends days on end watching Tadzio play on the beach, even following his family around the streets of Venice. Cholera infects the city, and although the authorities try to conceal the danger from the tourists, Aschenbach soon learns the facts about the lethal epidemic. However, he cannot bear to leave Tadzio and stays on in Venice. He becomes progressively daring in his pursuit of the boy, gradually becoming more and more debased, until he finally dies of the cholera, degraded, a slave to his passions, stripped of his dignity."

appease her, but Biff goes in search of Willy. He finds Willy planting
seeds in the garden with a flashlight. Willy is consulting Ben about
a $20,000 proposition. Biff approaches him

Oliver didn’t even recognize him. Upset at his father’s unrelenting
misconception that he, Biff, was a salesman for Oliver, Biff plans
to relieve Willy of his illusions. Willy enters, and Biff tries
gently, at first, to tell him what happened at Oliver’s office.

Bernard bursts in, again looking for Biff. Linda reminds Willy that
Biff has to return a football that he stole, and she adds that Biff is
too rough with the neighborhood girls. Willy hears The Woman laugh

This marks the beginning of a rebellious streak and a new group of friends for young Sinclair. He often goes out late into the night, drinking and carousing. However, he refrains from one of the activities popular among his friends: he refuses to go with them when they visit women because Sinclair has a yearning for love, not sex. One day in the park, Sinclair sees a girl who is, for him, the paradigm of beauty. She has some male features, but is surrounded by an incredibly alluring air. Though he never speaks to her, he names her Beatrice, and she becomes a symbol for him, an ideal for whom he acts. Immediately he reforms his behavior and ceases his activities with his friends.

Diary of a Young GirlAnne Frank,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/summary.html,"Since Anne’s diary is a true personal account of a life
in hiding, it is inappropriate to analyze it as a novel or other
work of fiction. Parts of the diary were intended for public view,
but others clearly were not. To appreciate and interpret the diary,
it is necessary to consider its horrible context, World War II and
the Holocaust, before any discussion of plot development or thematic
content."
Diary of a Young GirlAnne Frank,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/summary.html,"The Franks had moved to the Netherlands in the years
leading up to World War II to escape persecution in Germany. After
the Germans invaded the Netherlands in 1940,
the Franks were forced into hiding. With another family, the van
Daans, and an acquaintance, Mr. Dussel, they moved into a small
secret annex above Otto Frank’s office where they had stockpiled
food and supplies. The employees from Otto’s firm helped hide the
Franks and kept them supplied with food, medicine, and information
about the outside world."
Diary of a Young GirlAnne Frank,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/summary.html,"Anne’s diary begins on
her thirteenth birthday, June 12, 1942,
and ends shortly after her fifteenth. At the start of her diary,
Anne describes fairly typical girlhood experiences, writing about
her friendships with other girls, her crushes on boys, and her academic
performance at school. Because anti-Semitic laws forced Jews into
separate schools, Anne and her older sister, Margot, attended the
Jewish Lyceum in Amsterdam."
Diary of a Young GirlAnne Frank,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/summary.html,"The residents of the annex pay close attention to every
development of the war by listening to the radio. Some bits of news
catch Anne’s attention and make their way into her diary, providing
a vivid historical context for her personal thoughts. The adults
make optimistic bets about when the war will end, and their mood
is severely affected by Allied setbacks or German advances. Amsterdam
is devastated by the war during the two years the Franks are in hiding.
All of the city’s residents suffer, since food becomes scarce and
robberies more frequent."

Holocaust. Her diary describes a struggle to define herself within
this climate of oppression. Anne’s diary ends without comment on
August 1, 1944,
the end of a seemingly normal day that leaves us with the expectation
of seeing another entry on the next page. However, the Frank family
is betrayed to the Nazis and arrested on August 4, 1944.

loneliness. She has a tumultuous relationship with the adults in
the annex, particularly her mother, whom she considers lacking in
love and affection. She adores her father, but she is frequently
scolded and criticized by Mr. and Mrs. van Daan and Mr. Dussel.
Anne thinks that her sister, Margot, is smart, pretty, and agreeable,
but she does not feel close to her and does not write much about
her. Anne eventually develops a close friendship with Peter van
Daan, the teenage boy in the annex. Mr. Frank does not approve,
however, and the intensity of Anne’s infatuation begins to lessen."
Diary of a Young GirlAnne Frank,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/annefrank/summary.html,"Anne matures considerably throughout the course of her
diary entries, moving from detailed accounts of basic activities
to deeper, more profound thoughts about humanity and her own personal nature.
She finds it difficult to understand why the Jews are being singled
out and persecuted. Anne also confronts her own identity. Though
she considers herself to be German, her German citizenship has been
revoked, and though she calls Holland her home, many of the Dutch
have turned against the Jews. Anne feels a tremendous solidarity

Dicey and all her siblings are used to being loners, as growing up in Provincetown, their classmates teased and mocked them because of their mother's untraditional lifestyle. Dicey meets Jeff, an upperclassman who plays guitar, and though she regularly stops to listen to him and even sing with him while she collects her bicycle, she rebuffs all of his friendly advances. Similarly, she rejects the friendliness of Mina, a clever and popular girl in her class, who, despite Dicey's coldness, often engages her in conversation and even works with her as a partner on a project. As the days pass, Dicey notices the beginnings of problems in her siblings' lives. Maybeth continues to struggle with reading and fractions, James worries about whether or not his classmates will like him, and Sammy withdraws into himself in school. However, before long, Maybeth's music teacher has noticed the girl's gift for music and offered to give her piano lessons, James gets a paper route to help out, and Sammy agrees to help James. Dicey, used to acting like a mother, begins to feel isolated. Letters from Boston, where Momma is in a mental hospital, arrive regularly, but Gram only tells Dicey that there is no change in Momma's condition, adding to Dicey's sense of isolation."

The following morning, Gram leads Dicey into the mental hospital, and when Dicey sees Momma, she knows she is dying. Gram sits with Momma all day, and after sitting with her for a while, holding her hand and talking, Dicey ventures out into the streets with money Gram has given her to buy presents for her siblings. Dicey buys gifts, uplifted by remembering her siblings and finding things they will like. She returns to the hotel, and in the morning Momma is dead. Gram and Dicey, determined to bring Momma home with them, decide to have Momma cremated. They bring her home with them on the train in a wooden box Dicey found in a store the day before. In Wilmington, the children and Mr. Lingerle meet them and drive them home."

They had traveled all the way from Massachusetts, where the children's mother abandoned them, having become mentally ill. Gram is a terse, eccentric, guarded, and poor woman, but she takes the children in almost in spite of herself, and the book opens with the entire family looking forward warily to the first stage of their life together. Dicey, hardworking and independent, quickly gets a job cleaning the local grocery store and refurbishes an old sailboat in the barn. A few days into the school year, Gram writes the children's names into the family Bible and talks seriously to them about the possibility of adopting them. Gram does not often show emotion other than anger, and the children understand what a powerful statement of her love for them she is making when she does show those other emotions."

The next Monday, Gram, who has deduced that Sammy is fighting because his classmates are teasing him about her, visits the school and beats all the second graders at their new favorite game, marbles. Many of the children are impressed by Gram's skill and friendliness, and Sammy no longer feels the need to fight. That same day, Jeff asks Dicey to a dance.

Together, they decide to let Sammy know he should be himself and to ask James to help Maybeth with her reading. Sammy, after talking with Dicey while working together with her on the boat, begins to get in fights at school, causing Gram and Dicey a new set of worries. When Dicey receives her report card, she finds that she herself has problems to face: she is failing home economics and getting a C in English. She dismisses the home economics grade, as she despises the class, and decides to wait until their English essays are returned to ask her teacher about her grade. On the day he returns their essays, the teacher, Mr. Chappelle, reads Dicey's paper, which is about Momma, aloud as an exemplar of an excellent paper, but announces that the paper is plagiarized. Mina stands up and defends Dicey, and manages to prove that Dicey wrote the paper. The teacher, shamefaced, returns the paper and promises to change her grade."

After Tris’s first simulation, Four informs her she was able to escape the test much faster than anyone else. Still, she is stressed about the tests and angry at Peter, who’s been distributing Erudite reports accusing Abnegation of corruption. After another trip to the tattoo parlor, she flirts with a drunken Four. During her next simulation, she escapes the hallucination by manipulating it, leading Four to realize she’s Divergent. He warns her not to share her status with anyone. She again talks with Tori, who tells Tris that Dauntless leaders killed her brother when they learned he was Divergent."

She begins having doubts about her place in her new faction, and her worries intensify during a field trip to the compound wall to learn about Dauntless jobs. Late that night, Eric and Four take the initiates to Navy Pier, an abandoned park in the city, to play capture the flag.

Lastly, instead of following orders to shoot everyone in her family, she offers to sacrifice her own life. Afterward, Eric congratulates her on passing the test and informs her that all Dauntless members must be fitted with a tracking device.

and he begins his new career as a magician by summoning up Mephastophilis,
a devil. Despite Mephastophilis’s warnings about the horrors of
hell, Faustus tells the devil to return to his master, Lucifer,
with an offer of Faustus’s soul in exchange for twenty-four years
of service from Mephastophilis. Meanwhile, Wagner, Faustus’s servant,

does so, the words “Homo fuge,” Latin for “O man, fly,” appear branded
on his arm. Faustus again has second thoughts, but Mephastophilis bestows
rich gifts on him and gives him a book of spells to learn. Later,
Mephastophilis answers all of his questions about the nature of
the world, refusing to answer only when Faustus asks him who made
the universe. This refusal prompts yet another bout of misgivings

faithful squire. In return for Sancho’s services, Don Quixote promises
to make Sancho the wealthy governor of an isle. On his horse, Rocinante,

a bandit than a savior, stealing from and hurting baffled and justifiably angry
citizens while acting out against what he perceives as threats to
his knighthood or to the world. Don Quixote abandons a boy, leaving
him in the hands of an evil farmer simply because the farmer swears
an oath that he will not harm the boy. He steals a barber’s basin
that he believes to be the mythic Mambrino’s helmet, and he becomes
convinced of the healing powers of the Balsam of Fierbras, an elixir
that makes him so ill that, by comparison, he later feels healed.

Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/summary.html,"Puzzled, the lawyer visits Jekyll and their mutual friend
Dr. Lanyon to try to learn more. Lanyon reports that he no longer
sees much of Jekyll, since they had a dispute over the course of
Jekyll’s research, which Lanyon calls “unscientific balderdash.”
Curious, Utterson stakes out a building that Hyde visits—which,
it turns out, is a laboratory attached to the back of Jekyll’s home.
Encountering Hyde, Utterson is amazed by how undefinably ugly the
man seems, as if deformed, though Utterson cannot say exactly how.
Much to Utterson’s surprise, Hyde willingly offers Utterson his
address. Jekyll tells Utterson not to concern himself with the matter
of Hyde."
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/summary.html,"Utterson takes the document home, where first he reads
Lanyon’s letter; it reveals that Lanyon’s deterioration and eventual
death were caused by the shock of seeing Mr. Hyde take a potion
and metamorphose into Dr. Jekyll. The second letter constitutes
a testament by Jekyll. It explains how Jekyll, seeking to separate
his good side from his darker impulses, discovered a way to transform
himself periodically into a deformed monster free of conscience—Mr.
Hyde. At first, Jekyll reports, he delighted in becoming Hyde and
rejoiced in the moral freedom that the creature possessed. Eventually,
however, he found that he was turning into Hyde involuntarily in
his sleep, even without taking the potion. At this point, Jekyll
resolved to cease becoming Hyde. One night, however, the urge gripped
him too strongly, and after the transformation he immediately rushed
out and violently killed Sir Danvers Carew. Horrified, Jekyll tried
more adamantly to stop the transformations, and for a time he proved successful;
one day, however, while sitting in a park, he suddenly turned into
Hyde, the first time that an involuntary metamorphosis had happened
while he was awake."
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/summary.html,"On their weekly walk, an
eminently sensible, trustworthy lawyer named Mr. Utterson listens
as his friend Enfield tells a gruesome tale of assault. The tale describes
a sinister figure named Mr. Hyde who tramples a young girl, disappears
into a door on the street, and reemerges to pay off her relatives
with a check signed by a respectable gentleman. Since both Utterson
and Enfield disapprove of gossip, they agree to speak no further
of the matter. It happens, however, that one of Utterson’s clients
and close friends, Dr. Jekyll, has written a will transferring all
of his property to this same Mr. Hyde. Soon, Utterson begins having
dreams in which a faceless figure stalks through a nightmarish version
of London."
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/summary.html,"A year passes uneventfully. Then, one night, a servant
girl witnesses Hyde brutally beat to death an old man named Sir
Danvers Carew, a member of Parliament and a client of Utterson.
The police contact Utterson, and Utterson suspects Hyde as the murderer.
He leads the officers to Hyde’s apartment, feeling a sense of foreboding amid
the eerie weather—the morning is dark and wreathed in fog. When
they arrive at the apartment, the murderer has vanished, and police
searches prove futile. Shortly thereafter, Utterson again visits Jekyll,
who now claims to have ended all relations with Hyde; he shows Utterson
a note, allegedly written to Jekyll by Hyde, apologizing for the
trouble he has caused him and saying goodbye. That night, however,
Utterson’s clerk points out that Hyde’s handwriting bears a remarkable
similarity to Jekyll’s own."
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/summary.html,"The letter continues describing Jekyll’s cry for help.
Far from his laboratory and hunted by the police as a murderer,
Hyde needed Lanyon’s help to get his potions and become Jekyll again—but
when he undertook the transformation in Lanyon’s presence, the shock
of the sight instigated Lanyon’s deterioration and death. Meanwhile, Jekyll
returned to his home, only to find himself ever more helpless and
trapped as the transformations increased in frequency and necessitated
even larger doses of potion in order to reverse themselves. It was
the onset of one of these spontaneous metamorphoses that caused
Jekyll to slam his laboratory window shut in the middle of his conversation
with Enfield and Utterson. Eventually, the potion began to run out,
and Jekyll was unable to find a key ingredient to make more. His
ability to change back from Hyde into Jekyll slowly vanished. Jekyll
writes that even as he composes his letter he knows that he will
soon become Hyde permanently, and he wonders if Hyde will face execution
for his crimes or choose to kill himself. Jekyll notes that, in
any case, the end of his letter marks the end of the life of Dr.
Jekyll. With these words, both the document and the novel come to
a close."
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/jekyll/summary.html,"For a few months, Jekyll acts especially friendly and
sociable, as if a weight has been lifted from his shoulders. But
then Jekyll suddenly begins to refuse visitors, and Lanyon dies
from some kind of shock he received in connection with Jekyll. Before
dying, however, Lanyon gives Utterson a letter, with instructions
that he not open it until after Jekyll’s death. Meanwhile, Utterson
goes out walking with Enfield, and they see Jekyll at a window of
his laboratory; the three men begin to converse, but a look of horror
comes over Jekyll’s face, and he slams the window and disappears.
Soon afterward, Jekyll’s butler, Mr. Poole, visits Utterson in a
state of desperation: Jekyll has secluded himself in his laboratory
for several weeks, and now the voice that comes from the room sounds
nothing like the doctor’s. Utterson and Poole travel to Jekyll’s
house through empty, windswept, sinister streets; once there, they
find the servants huddled together in fear. After arguing for a
time, the two of them resolve to break into Jekyll’s laboratory.
Inside, they find the body of Hyde, wearing Jekyll’s clothes and
apparently dead by suicide—and a letter from Jekyll to Utterson
promising to explain everything."

Electra informs her sister that, to the contrary, Orestes is dead, and that is revenge is to be achieved, the sisters must take matters into their own hands. Chrysothemis rejects the idea as too risky, and leaves Electra to her grieving. Orestes then approaches with Pylades in the character of a Phocian, carrying an urn that, it is pretended, contains Orestes' ashes. Electra's despair is heightened, and she takes the urn and laments over it at length. Orestes, visibly affected by the sight of his sister's suffering, reveals himself to her, displaying their father's ring as proof of his identity.

her aunt Nadine, and her cousin Dora. Nadine and Dora treat Ellen
condescendingly and ignore her for being ""cheap,"" though they have
little more money than Ellen and far less integrity. For Christmas,
Ellen wants to give Nadine and Dora a wonderful gift. Because she
cannot afford to buy them a present, Ellen uses her artistic talent
and paints them a picture of two cute-looking cats. Ellen would
not have personally chosen to paint cats, as they are empty of any
deep emotional quality, though she knows that Nadine and Dora will appreciate
them more than her pictures of the brooding ocean. When Nadine asks
Ellen what she wants for Christmas, Ellen asks only for a package
of art paper, though she secretly hopes that Nadine will give her
a few other surprise gifts. Ellen works up her hope for these other
few gifts and for Nadine and Dora's appreciation of her cat painting.
Both of her hopes, disappointingly, are crushed on Christmas Day
when she receives only the pack of white paper and later overhears
Nadine and Dora making disparaging remarks about her painting, though
Nadine had pretended to like it earlier that morning. Upon hearing
this, Ellen is deeply ashamed and, moreover, enraged. She shuts
herself in her room, and when Dora and Nadine aggravate her, she
retaliates. Nadine orders Ellen out of her house on Christmas day,

Emma takes it upon herself to find an eligible match for her new
friend, Harriet Smith. Though Harriet’s parentage is unknown, Emma
is convinced that Harriet deserves to be a gentleman’s wife and
sets her friend’s sights on Mr. Elton, the village vicar. Meanwhile,
Emma persuades Harriet to reject the proposal of Robert Martin,

He believes that Mr. Martin is a worthy young man whom Harriet would
be lucky to marry. He and Emma quarrel over Emma’s meddling, and,

Frank saves Harriet from Gypsy beggars. When Harriet tells Emma

to the station himself. In a fit of nostalgia, he takes her by a
roundabout route, and they eventually end up stopping at the crest
of a village hill in order to take a sledding adventure they had
once proposed but had never undertaken. A successful first run prompts
Mattie to suggest a second, but with a different purpose in mind.
She asks Ethan to run the sled into the elm tree at the foot of
the hill, allowing them to spend their last moments together. Ethan
initially rejects her proposal but is slowly won over, and they
take their positions on the sled, locking themselves in a final
embrace. In the wake of the collision, Ethan comes to consciousness
dazedly, reaching out to feel the face of the softly moaning Mattie,
who opens her eyes and weakly utters his name."

many reminders of the absent Zeena. Catastrophe threatens when the

out to celebrate their dinner together, but Ethan quickly pieces
the shards together and tucks the broken dish back in its place.

He has come to the church to fetch his wife’s cousin, Mattie Silver,

EverymanPhilip Roth,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/everyman/summary.html,"Mourners surround an open grave of an unnamed man (the everyman). Present are former advertising colleagues, friends from the retirement village, the everyman’s three children Nancy, Randy and Lonny, his older brother Howie and Howie’s wife, his ex-wife Phoebe, and Maureen, who was his private nurse. One by one, the everyman’s loved ones drop handfuls of soil onto his coffin, starting with Nancy, who delivers a eulogy explaining her relationship to the everyman, and followed by Howie, who recounts childhood memories of the everyman, in particular their father’s shop in Elizabeth, New Jersey. The funeral ends and the mourners walk away from the grave. The book shifts to the night before the everyman’s last operation, during which he dies, as the everyman thinks back on the women in his life who were present at other operations, from his third and final wife Merete, to Maureen, with whom he had an affair with while married to Merete, to his mother who accompanied him to the hospital for a hernia operation when he was a child. He remembers the hernia operation in great detail as a formative experience that shapes his fear of death and illness for the rest of his life."
EverymanPhilip Roth,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/everyman/summary.html,"Living in the retirement community, the everyman finds trying to pass the time without company or painting very difficult. He sustains himself with memories and then his fantasies, first of seducing the woman jogger who rejects him, then of living with Nancy and her family in New York. This fantasy ends when Phoebe has a stroke and Nancy plans to look after her. The everyman makes several phone calls, first to Gwen, the recent widow of a former colleague, then Brad Karr, a former colleague who is now a patient in a psychiatric hospital, and finally Ezra Pollock, another former colleague who is suffering from terminal cancer. These calls exhaust and depress him and once more make him confront the idea of the inevitability and pitilessness of aging and death. The everyman later receives the upsetting news that Ezra Pollock has died, and soon after, tests show that the everyman needs a surgery on his second carotid artery."
EverymanPhilip Roth,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/everyman/summary.html,"The everyman teaches painting classes in his retirement village. One student, Millicent Kramer, is a recent widow suffering from terrible back pain and a sense of humiliation over her perceived helplessness and dependency. She later kills herself, which forces the everyman again to face his own mortality. The everyman’s relationship with Howie becomes worse because he envies Howie’s good health. Because of this, the everyman deliberately isolates himself from Howie. He also feels lonely because he no longer has the romantic company of women in his life. After a polite rejection from a young jogger outside his condo, the everyman stops painting, despite Nancy’s encouragement to keep making pictures. Earlier, in his fifties, the everyman had an affair with first his secretary, a woman of nineteen, then a twenty-four-year-old model named Merete. His second wife Phoebe reveals she is aware of the affairs after Merete and the everyman fly to Paris to be with each other. The everyman then leaves Phoebe to marry Merete. The marriage is not a success because Merete is vain and weak and cannot support him when he gets sick."

Though the everyman himself is strongly anti-religion, his father had become more religious in his old age. Watching his father being buried by Howie and his sons is a dreadful experience for the everyman, who is still recovering from his operation. This is because he must finally stare oblivion in the face and acknowledge that everyone’s life ends in death. After another nine years of good health, the everyman falls ill again and has a stent inserted into his arteries. A few years after this he leaves Manhattan in the wake of the 9/11 bombings and moves to the Starfish Beach retirement village at the Jersey Shore and takes up painting, his passion. The only thing he misses about New York is his daughter Nancy, with whom he has a good relationship. But the year after the stent operation, he has another operation, this time on his carotid artery. From then on he is hospitalized every year for problems with his heart and arteries. Nancy is there to provide reassurance. The everyman thinks of her goodness as a miracle. In contrast, he does not get on at all with his sons Randy and Lonny."
EverymanPhilip Roth,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/everyman/summary.html,"The everyman becomes unwell after a holiday on Martha’s Vineyard with his new love, Phoebe. He had left behind his first wife Cecelia and their two sons for Phoebe, and is suffering from guilt. His mind turns to the fear of oblivion. He returns to New York, and an analyst tells him he is feeling ill because of internalized envy of a colleague. The everyman eventually persuades his doctor to admit him to hospital. There, it turns out he is suffering from a burst appendix and could have died. Phoebe and Howie help the everyman through his recovery. Twenty-two years pass while the everyman is in good health. Then, in 1989, the everyman becomes ill again. He thinks it is brought about by the stress of watching his father slowly dying, but it is due to heart disease. His experiences in the hospital this time remind him of his boyhood operation, but he no longer has his mother to reassure him. Merete is completely overwhelmed but Howie steps in to provide private nurses to look after the everyman. This is how the everyman meets Maureen, and they begin their affair."
EverymanPhilip Roth,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/everyman/summary.html,"The everyman considers his relationships with his loved ones and becomes increasingly gloomy. He tries unsuccessfully to reconnect with Howie, who happens to be away on holiday. Broken-hearted, lonely and in poor health, the everyman finally allows himself to confront his end. He goes to the cemetery where his parents and grandparents are buried and communes with his parents’ bones, which reassure him about his life. Even though the everyman does not believe in an afterlife, the reality of their bones is a source of comfort and he finds it hard to leave them behind. As an excuse not to leave, he strikes up a conversation with a gravedigger. In minute detail, the gravedigger describes the process of burial. The everyman is comforted by the dutiful work that goes into the process of digging and filling a grave. Going into his operation, he is in a good mood. He remembers the joy of being a young boy swimming in the sea. But choosing general anesthetic instead of local anesthetic leads to his death on the operating table. He has finally succumbed to the oblivion he feared."

insist that such thoughts are futile and dangerous, Richie feels
compelled to find meaning within the chaos. He also longs for some
way to communicate his confused thoughts and emotions to his family,

Fallen AngelsWalter Dean Myers,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/fallenangels/summary.html,"As Richie searches for meaning in the war, he also searches
for his own sense of self. He struggles to unravel his motivations
for enlisting in the army, wondering whether his reason was a selfless
one, based on the desire to earn money to provide for Kenny, or
a selfish one—simply to escape from the hard life he faced in Harlem.
Richie also forces himself to confront the uncomfortable question
of what he will do when he returns to civilian life. Though he is
highly intelligent and highly motivated and has ambitions to become
a writer, his family is too poor to send him to college. Richie’s
father abandoned the family years ago, and his mother has since
become an alcoholic. Richie is afraid that without an education
he has no career potential, and he is unsure what he has to look
forward to if he survives."

Farewell to ManzanarJeanne Wakatsuki Houston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/manzanar/summary.html,"In April 1972,
much later in life, Jeanne visits the Manzanar site with her husband
and two children. She needs to remind herself that the camp actually
existed, because over the years she has begun to think she imagined
the whole thing. Walking through the ruins, the sounds and images
of the camp come back to her. Seeing her eleven-year-old daughter,
Jeanne realizes that her life began at the camp just as her father’s
life ended there. She recalls Papa driving crazily through camp
before leaving with his family, and she finally understands his
stubborn pride."
Farewell to ManzanarJeanne Wakatsuki Houston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/manzanar/summary.html,"Jeanne retreats into herself and nearly drops out of school,
but when Papa moves the family to San Jose to take up berry farming, she
decides to make another attempt at school life. Her homeroom nominates
her to be queen of the school’s annual spring carnival, and for
the election assembly she leaves her hair loose and wears an exotic
sarong. The teachers try to prevent her from winning, but her friend
Leonard Rodriguez uncovers the teachers’ plot and ensures her victory.
Papa is furious that Jeanne has won the election by flaunting her
sexuality in front of American boys. He forces her to take Japanese
dance lessons, but she stops taking them after a short time. As
a compromise, she wears a conservative dress to the coronation ceremony,
but the crowd’s muttering makes her realize that neither the exotic
sarong nor the conservative dress represents her true self."
Farewell to ManzanarJeanne Wakatsuki Houston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/manzanar/summary.html,"After the riots, camp life calms down and the Wakatsuki
family moves to a nicer barracks near a pear orchard, where Papa
takes up gardening. Manzanar itself begins to resemble a typical
American town. Schools open, the residents are allowed to take short
trips outside the camp, and Jeanne’s oldest brother, Bill, even
forms a dance band called The Jive Bombers. Jeanne explores the
world inside the camp and tries out various Japanese and American
hobbies before taking up baton twirling. She also returns to her
religious studies and is just about to be baptized when Papa intervenes. Jeanne
begins to distance herself from Papa, while the birth of a grandchild
draws Mama and Papa closer than ever."

Cabrillo Homes. Though they fear public hatred, they see little
sign of it. On the first day of sixth grade, however, a girl in Jeanne’s
class is amazed at Jeanne’s ability to speak English, which makes
Jeanne realize that prejudice is not always open and direct. She
later becomes close friends with the girl, Radine, who lives in
the same housing project. The two share the same activities and
tastes, but when they move to high school, unspoken prejudice keeps
Jeanne from the social and extracurricular successes available to
Radine."

at Fort Lincoln detention camp. The family is unsure how to greet
him. Only Jeanne welcomes him openly. Jeanne has always admired
Papa, who left his samurai, or warrior class, family in Japan to
protest the declining social status of the samurai. She looks back
fondly on the style with which he has always conducted himself,
from his courting of Mama to his virtuoso pig carving. Something
has happened to Papa, however, during his time at the detention
camp, where the government interrogators have accused him of disloyalty
and spying. The accusation is an insult and has sent Papa into a
downward emotional spiral. He becomes violent and drinks heavily,
and nearly strikes Mama with his cane before Kiyo, Papa’s youngest
son, saves her by punching Papa in the face."
Farewell to ManzanarJeanne Wakatsuki Houston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/manzanar/summary.html,"The frustration of the other men in camp eventually results
in an event called the December Riot, which breaks out after three
men are arrested for beating a man suspected of helping the U.S.
government. The rioters roam the camp searching for inu, a
word that means both “dog” and “traitor” in Japanese. The military
police try to put an end to the riot, but in the chaos they shoot
into the crowd, killing two Japanese and wounding ten others. The
same night, a patrol group accosts Jeanne’s brother-in-law Kaz and
his fellow workers and accuses them of sabotage. The mess hall bells
ring until noon the following day as a memorial to the dead. Soon
after, the government issues a Loyalty Oath to distinguish loyal
Japanese from potential enemies. Camp opinion about whether to take
the oath is divided. Answering “No No” to the loyalty questions
will result in deportation, but answering “Yes Yes” will result
in being drafted. Both Papa and Woody, one of his sons,
endorse the “Yes Yes” position, and Papa attacks a man for calling
him an inu, or collaborator. That night, Jeanne
overhears Papa singing the Japanese national anthem, Kimi
ga yo, which speaks of the endurance of stones."

cramped living conditions, badly prepared food, unfinished barracks,
and swirling dust that blows in through every crack and knothole.
There is not enough warm clothing to go around, many people fall
ill from immunizations and poorly preserved food, and they must
face the indignity of the nonpartitioned camp toilets, an insult
that particularly affects Mama. The Wakatsukis stop eating together
in the camp mess halls, and the family begins to disintegrate. Jeanne,
virtually abandoned by her family, takes an interest in the other
people in camp and begins studying religious questions with a pair
of nuns. However, after Jeanne experiences sunstroke while imagining
herself as a suffering saint, Papa orders her to stop."

the number of people at Manzanar dwindles as men are drafted and
families take advantage of the government’s new policy of relocating
families away from the west coast. Woody is drafted and, despite
Papa’s protests, leaves in November to join the famous all-Nisei 442nd
Combat Regiment. While in the military, Woody visits Papa’s family
in Hiroshima, Japan. He meets Toyo, Papa’s aunt, and finally understands
the origin of Papa’s pride. In December, the U.S. Supreme Court
rules that the internment policy is illegal, and the War Department
begins preparations to close the camps. The remaining residents,
out of fear and lack of prospects, try to postpone their departure,
but eventually they are ordered to leave. Papa decides to leave
in style and buys a broken-down blue sedan to ferry his family back
to Long Beach."

Papa burns his Japanese flag and identity papers but is arrested
by the FBI. Mama moves the family to the Japanese ghetto on Terminal Island
and then to Boyle Heights in Los Angeles. President Roosevelt’s

Franny and Zooey,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/franny/summary.html,"Franny and Zooey is composed of two sections, which were originally published in the New Yorker magazine as two separate short stories. The first story or section, ""Franny,"" was published in the New Yorker in January 1955. In ""Franny,"" Franny Glass meets her boyfriend Lane Coutell for a football weekend at his college. They do not get to join many of the festivities, though, because during their first lunch together, Franny begins to have a breakdown. She tells Lane that she is sick of the phoniness at school and of the egotism of the faculty. She has quit the play she was in because she is embarrassed about what she feels to be acting fake. As she gets worked up, she reveals that she has become interested in the ""Jesus prayer,"" a continuous prayer meant to cleanse one's spirit. Lane mostly brushes off Franny's concerns until she faints on the way to the bathroom. As he is helping to revive her, she begins to speak the prayer."

The man claiming to be the author of the story is Buddy Glass, one of Franny and Zooey's older brothers. The story resumes. It is the Monday after the weekend Franny's breakdown started, and Zooey is at home in New York City. In his conversation with his mother, Bessie Glass, it is revealed that Franny is now at home, sleeping and crying on the living room sofa. Bessie wants Zooey to talk to Franny, which he eventually does. The two of them have a long theological and personal discussion. We learn that the two of them have basically been raised on a blend of different religions, taught to them by their older brothers Buddy and Seymour. Over the course of this long discussion, Zooey helps Franny sort out her spiritual and personal beliefs, allowing her, by the end, to find peace."

garments for animal skins as a way of mourning Enkidu, he sets off
into the wilderness, determined to find Utnapishtim, the Mesopotamian
Noah. After the flood, the gods had granted Utnapishtim eternal
life, and Gilgamesh hopes that Utnapishtim can tell him how he might
avoid death too. Gilgamesh’s journey takes him to the twin-peaked
mountain called Mashu, where the sun sets into one side of the mountain
at night and rises out of the other side in the morning. Utnapishtim
lives beyond the mountain, but the two scorpion monsters that guard
its entrance refuse to allow Gilgamesh into the tunnel that passes
through it. Gilgamesh pleads with them, and they relent."

tries and immediately fails. So Utnapishtim orders him to clean
himself up, put on his royal garments again, and return to Uruk
where he belongs. Just as Gilgamesh is departing, however, Utnapishtim’s wife
convinces him to tell Gilgamesh about a miraculous plant that restores
youth. Gilgamesh finds the plant and takes it with him, planning

suckling at their breasts, grazing in the meadows, and drinking
at their watering places. A hunter discovers him and sends a temple
prostitute into the wilderness to tame him. In that time, people
considered women and sex calming forces that could domesticate wild
men like Enkidu and bring them into the civilized world. When Enkidu
sleeps with the woman, the animals reject him since he is no longer
one of them. Now, he is part of the human world. Then the harlot
teaches him everything he needs to know to be a man. Enkidu is outraged
by what he hears about Gilgamesh’s excesses, so he travels to Uruk
to challenge him. When he arrives, Gilgamesh is about to force his
way into a bride’s wedding chamber. Enkidu steps into the doorway

his purpose, she directs him to Urshanabi, the ferryman. Urshanabi
takes Gilgamesh on the boat journey across the sea and through the
Waters of Death to Utnapishtim. Utnapishtim tells Gilgamesh the
story of the flood—how the gods met in council and decided to destroy
humankind. Ea, the god of wisdom, warned Utnapishtim about the gods’
plans and told him how to fashion a gigantic boat in which his family
and the seed of every living creature might escape. When the waters

GilgameshAnonymous,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gilgamesh/summary.html,"The epic’s prelude offers a general introduction
to Gilgamesh, king of Uruk, who was two-thirds god and one-third
man. He built magnificent ziggurats, or temple towers, surrounded
his city with high walls, and laid out its orchards and fields.
He was physically beautiful, immensely strong, and very wise. Although
Gilgamesh was godlike in body and mind, he began his kingship as
a cruel despot. He lorded over his subjects, raping any woman who
struck his fancy, whether she was the wife of one of his warriors
or the daughter of a nobleman. He accomplished his building projects
with forced labor, and his exhausted subjects groaned under his
oppression. The gods heard his subjects’ pleas and decided to keep
Gilgamesh in check by creating a wild man named Enkidu, who was
as magnificent as Gilgamesh. Enkidu became Gilgamesh’s great friend, and
Gilgamesh’s heart was shattered when Enkidu died of an illness inflicted
by the gods. Gilgamesh then traveled to the edge of the world and
learned about the days before the deluge and other secrets of the
gods, and he recorded them on stone tablets."

Levene is still trying to tout the story of his tremendous sale, but Moss ignores him. This leads to a confrontation between Moss and Roma, in which Roma stands up for Levene and Moss accuses Roma of thinking he is the ruler of the office just because he happens to be on a hot sales streak."
Glengarry Glen RossDavid Mamet,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/glengarry/summary.html,"In the second scene, Moss and Aaronow discuss how unfair these policies are. Moss talks about a former salesman, Graff, who has gone off to start his own company. Moss tells Aaronow that Graff's business practices are both wiser and kinder than Mitch and Murray's. Moss suggests that someone should break into their office, steal the good leads, and sell them to Graff. Though Moss pretends at first to be harmlessly thinking out loud, it becomes clear that he really has planned this crime, and that furthermore he wants Aaronow to commit the break- in. If Aaronow does not rob the office, Moss threatens, then Moss will have to do it himself, and if he gets caught, he will tell the police that Aaronow was his accomplice."

Go Tell it on the MountainJames Baldwin,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gotellit/summary.html,"In Go Tell It on the Mountain, author James Baldwin describes the course of the fourteenth birthday of John Grimes in Harlem, 1935. Baldwin also uses extended flashback episodes to recount the lives of John's parents and aunt and to link this urban boy in the North to his slave grandmother in an earlier South. The first section follows John's thoughts, the second mostly his aunt's, the third his father's, the fourth his mother's, and the fifth again mostly John's."

Before the night is over John will undergo a religious transformation, experiencing salvation on the ""threshing-floor"" of his family's storefront Harlem church. Yet this will not earn him his father's love. What John does not know, but the reader does, is that the man he thinks is his father—Gabriel—is, in fact, his stepfather; unbeknownst to John, Gabriel's resentment of him has nothing to do with himself and everything to do with Gabriel's own concealed past."
Go Tell it on the MountainJames Baldwin,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gotellit/summary.html,"The title Go Tell It on the Mountain comes from a Negro spiritual. The novel is steeped in the language of the King James Bible, and the Bible is a constant presence in the characters' lives; thus, a familiarity with Biblical stories can enhance the reader's understanding of the text. At the heart of the story three main conflicts intertwine: a clash between father and son, a coming-of-age struggle, and a religious crisis. Baldwin deals with issues of race and racism more elliptically in this novel than in his other works, but these issues inform all three of the text's central problems—indeed, according to some critics, these issues take center stage in the book, though subtly."

has died and left most of her fortune to the Pockets; Biddy has taught
Joe how to read and write. After Joe leaves, Pip decides to rush
home after him and marry Biddy, but when he arrives there he discovers
that she and Joe have already married."
Great Expectations,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/greatex/summary.html,"Pip decides to go abroad with Herbert to work in the mercantile trade.
Returning many years later, he encounters Estella in the ruined
garden at Satis House. Drummle, her husband, treated her badly,
but he is now dead. Pip finds that Estella’s coldness and cruelty
have been replaced by a sad kindness, and the two leave the garden
hand in hand, Pip believing that they will never part again. (Note: Dickens’s
original ending to Great Expectations differed from
the one described in this summary. The final Summary and Analysis
section of this SparkNote provides a description of the first ending
and explains why Dickens rewrote it.)"
Great Expectations,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/greatex/summary.html,"Pip is appalled, but he feels morally bound to help Magwitch escape
London, as the convict is pursued both by the police and by Compeyson,
his former partner in crime. A complicated mystery begins to fall
into place when Pip discovers that Compeyson was the man who abandoned
Miss Havisham at the altar and that Estella is Magwitch’s daughter.
Miss Havisham has raised her to break men’s hearts, as revenge for
the pain her own broken heart caused her. Pip was merely a boy for
the young Estella to practice on; Miss Havisham delighted in Estella’s
ability to toy with his affections."

a Scylding religious ceremony. When all the other priests have left,
Grendel meets an old, blind priest and pretends to be the supreme
Scylding deity, known as the Destroyer. Grendel asks the old priest,
Ork, to say what he knows about the Destroyer, and Ork offers him
a complex metaphysical system he has spent years working out. Ork
is almost moved to a state of ecstasy by the experience, and a puzzled Grendel
withdraws as three younger priests come to chastise Ork for his
strange behavior. A fourth priest meets them and is overjoyed at
the news of Ork’s vision."
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"As a young monster, Grendel lives with his mother in a
cave on the outskirts of human civilization. A foul, wretched creature
who long ago abandoned language, Grendel’s mother is his only kin
or companion. One day, the young Grendel discovers a lake full of
firesnakes and, swimming through it, reaches the human world on
the other side. On one of his early explorations he finds himself
caught in a tree. A bull and then a band of humans attack Grendel
before his mother rescues him."
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"Eventually, Hrothgar’s power and fortune attract the services
of the Shaper, a court bard who sings glorious tales of Danish kings and
heroes. Though the Shaper’s songs are only partially based on fact,
their imaginative visions of a supremely ordered moral world are
incredibly powerful and invigorating. Inspired by the Shaper’s words,
Hrothgar builds a magnificent meadhall and names it Hart. Even Grendel,
who has witnessed the true, savage history of the Danes, finds the
Shaper’s vision extremely seductive and becomes ashamed at his own
brute, bestial nature."
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"Grendel becomes fascinated with the world of men, watching from
a safe distance as mankind evolves from a nomadic, tribal culture
into a feudal system with roads, governments, and militaries. He
is alternately befuddled by their actions and disgusted by their wasteful,
brute violence. Grendel watches as Hrothgar of the Danes (also known
as the Scyldings, after an illustrious ancestor) develops into the
most powerful king in the area."
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"Grendel, increasingly upset by his split feelings about
the Shaper, visits a dragon in search of some advice. The dragon
belittles the Shaper and declares all moral and philosophical systems
pointless and irrelevant. Grendel gradually adopts this worldview
and becomes enraged at the humans. He begins to raid Hart systematically,
initiating the twelve-year war. In his first battle, Grendel handily
defeats Unferth, one of Hrothgar’s mightiest thanes (or soldiers), and
adds insult to injury by scoffing at Unferth’s romantic ideas of heroism."
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"Grendel, a large bearlike monster, has
spent the last twelve years locked in a war against a band of humans.
The main action of Grendel takes place in the last
year of that war, but the novel skips back in time in order to illuminate
the origins of the conflict as well as Grendel’s personal history."
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"Other kings increasingly threaten Hrothgar, who preemptively tries
to attack one of them: Hygmod, king of the Helmings. In order to
avoid a war, Hygmod offers Hrothgar the hand of his sister, Wealtheow,
in marriage. Hrothgar accepts, and Wealtheow becomes the much beloved
queen of the Scyldings, bringing a new sense of peace and harmony
to the vulgar, masculine world of Hart. The lovely queen briefly
enraptures Grendel, and only a nighttime attack and a cold, misogynistic
look at her genitals rids him of her spell."
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"When the Geats and the Scyldings fall asleep, Grendel
attacks Hart. Beowulf manages to surprise Grendel and grabs his
arm. As they struggle, Grendel slips on a pool of blood, and Beowulf
gains the upper hand. Beowulf begins whispering madly in Grendel’s
ear. Grendel moves in and out of a series of hallucinations in which
he sees Beowulf sprouting an enormous pair of wings. Beowulf smashes
Grendel against a wall, cracking his head open and demanding that
he “sing of walls.” Beowulf manages to rip Grendel’s arm off at
the shoulder, and Grendel runs off into the night. He finds himself
at the edge of a cliff, staring down into its dark, murky depths.
A host of animals gather around Grendel, seeming to condemn him,
and the novel closes as Grendel whispers to them, “Poor Grendel’s
had an accident. . . . So may you all.”"
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"Some years later, Hrothgar’s brother Halga is killed,
and Halga’s orphaned son, Hrothulf, comes to live at Hart. Hrothgar
and Wealtheow already have two sons of their own, and the presence
of so many possible heirs to the Scylding throne makes Wealtheow
nervous. Hrothulf, for his part, is disgusted by the split he sees
between the laboring class and the aristocracy, and he plans a revolutionary overthrow
of the government. Hrothulf’s counselor, a peasant named Red Horse,
tries to convince Hrothulf that all governments are inherently evil
and that a revolution merely replaces one corrupt system with another."
GrendelJohn Gardner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/grendel/summary.html,"Later the same winter, the Shaper dies. Grendel experiences
an increasing feeling of dread, though he cannot place it or puzzle
it out. His mother senses it also, and though she tries warning
Grendel, she can only produce the gibberish phrase “Warrovish,”
which Grendel later deciphers to mean “Beware the fish.” Fifteen
strangers arrive from over the sea: they are Geats, and their leader
is Beowulf, who has come to rid the Scyldings of Grendel. Grendel
knows that the Geats are what he has been waiting for, and he is
alternately frightened and excited. The Scyldings are none too pleased
at Beowulf’s arrival, and that night at dinner, Unferth taunts Beowulf for
famously having lost a swimming contest. Beowulf coldly responds
that Unferth has been misled, and calmly declares that Unferth is
doomed to hell because he killed his own brothers."
Gulliver’s TravelsJonathan Swift,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gulliver/summary.html,"Next, Gulliver sets sail again and, after an attack by
pirates, ends up in Laputa, where a floating island inhabited by
theoreticians and academics oppresses the land below, called Balnibarbi.
The scientific research undertaken in Laputa and in Balnibarbi seems
totally inane and impractical, and its residents too appear wholly
out of touch with reality. Taking a short side trip to Glubbdubdrib, Gulliver
is able to witness the conjuring up of figures from history, such
as Julius Caesar and other military leaders, whom he finds much
less impressive than in books. After visiting the Luggnaggians and
the Struldbrugs, the latter of which are senile immortals who prove
that age does not bring wisdom, he is able to sail to Japan and from
there back to England."
Gulliver’s TravelsJonathan Swift,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gulliver/summary.html,"Gulliver’s Travels recounts
the story of Lemuel Gulliver, a practical-minded Englishman trained
as a surgeon who takes to the seas when his business fails. In a
deadpan first-person narrative that rarely shows any signs of self-reflection
or deep emotional response, Gulliver narrates the adventures that
befall him on these travels."
Gulliver’s TravelsJonathan Swift,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gulliver/summary.html,"Finally, on his fourth journey, Gulliver sets out as
captain of a ship, but after the mutiny of his crew and a long confinement
in his cabin, he arrives in an unknown land. This land is populated
by Houyhnhnms, rational-thinking horses who rule, and by Yahoos, brutish
humanlike creatures who serve the Houyhnhnms. Gulliver sets about
learning their language, and when he can speak he narrates his voyages
to them and explains the constitution of England. He is treated
with great courtesy and kindness by the horses and is enlightened
by his many conversations with them and by his exposure to their
noble culture. He wants to stay with the Houyhnhnms, but his bared
body reveals to the horses that he is very much like a Yahoo, and
he is banished. Gulliver is grief-stricken but agrees to leave.
He fashions a canoe and makes his way to a nearby island, where
he is picked up by a Portuguese ship captain who treats him well,
though Gulliver cannot help now seeing the captain—and all humans—as
shamefully Yahoolike. Gulliver then concludes his narrative with
a claim that the lands he has visited belong by rights to England,
as her colonies, even though he questions the whole idea of colonialism."
Gulliver’s TravelsJonathan Swift,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gulliver/summary.html,"Gulliver’s adventure in Lilliput begins when he wakes
after his shipwreck to find himself bound by innumerable tiny threads
and addressed by tiny captors who are in awe of him but fiercely
protective of their kingdom. They are not afraid to use violence
against Gulliver, though their arrows are little more than pinpricks.
But overall, they are hospitable, risking famine in their land by
feeding Gulliver, who consumes more food than a thousand Lilliputians combined
could. Gulliver is taken into the capital city by a vast wagon the
Lilliputians have specially built. He is presented to the emperor,
who is entertained by Gulliver, just as Gulliver is flattered by
the attention of royalty. Eventually Gulliver becomes a national resource,
used by the army in its war against the people of Blefuscu, whom
the Lilliputians hate for doctrinal differences concerning the proper
way to crack eggs. But things change when Gulliver is convicted
of treason for putting out a fire in the royal palace with his urine
and is condemned to be shot in the eyes and starved to death. Gulliver
escapes to Blefuscu, where he
is able to repair a boat he finds and set sail for England."
Gulliver’s TravelsJonathan Swift,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gulliver/summary.html,"After staying in England with his wife and family for
two months, Gulliver undertakes his next sea voyage, which takes
him to a land of giants called Brobdingnag. Here, a field worker discovers
him. The farmer initially treats him as little more than an animal, keeping
him for amusement. The farmer eventually sells Gulliver to the queen, who
makes him a courtly diversion and is entertained by his musical talents.
Social life is easy for Gulliver after his discovery by the court,
but not particularly enjoyable. Gulliver is often repulsed by the
physicality of the Brobdingnagians, whose ordinary flaws are many
times magnified by their huge size. Thus, when a couple of courtly
ladies let him play on their naked bodies, he is not attracted to
them but rather disgusted by their enormous skin pores and the sound
of their torrential urination. He is generally startled by the ignorance
of the people here—even the king knows nothing about politics. More
unsettling findings in Brobdingnag come in the form of various animals
of the realm that endanger his life. Even Brobdingnagian insects
leave slimy trails on his food that make eating difficult. On a
trip to the frontier, accompanying the royal couple, Gulliver leaves
Brobdingnag when his cage is plucked up by an eagle and dropped
into the sea."

Willie sits up, and Winnie turns to see blood trickling from his bald head. Winnie tells him to put on his underwear, which he does not do. She proclaims it will be ""another happy day"" as he reads a newspaper. Willie reads out a headline that announces the death in the bathtub of a priest, and reads about a job opening for youth.

Mass chaos ensues, since Harry is too young. But because the Goblet's decision is final, it is generally decided that Harry is obligated to compete. Gryffindor House is triumphant, but Ron is sullen and envious, and he doesn't speak to Harry for quite some time. School resumes, and Harry is frustrated that few people believe he didn't place his own name in the Goblet of Fire.

contact Ron’s older brother, who studies dragons. They arrange to
get rid of the dragon but get caught. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are severely
punished, and Gryffindor is docked 150 points.
Furthermore, part of their punishment is to go into the enchanted
forest with Hagrid to find out who has been killing unicorns recently.
In the forest, Harry comes upon a hooded man drinking unicorn blood.
The man tries to attack Harry, but Harry is rescued by a friendly
centaur who tells him that his assailant was Voldemort. Harry also

feats as they get closer and closer to the stone. Harry ultimately
finds himself face to face with Quirrell, who announces that Harry
must die. Knowing that Harry desires to find the stone, Quirrell
puts Harry in front of the Mirror of Erised and makes him state what
he sees. Harry sees himself with the stone in his pocket, and at that
same moment he actually feels it in his pocket. But he tells Quirrell
that he sees something else. A voice tells Quirrell that the boy
is lying and requests to speak to Harry face to face. Quirrell removes his
turban and reveals Voldemort’s face on the back of his head. Voldemort,

HatchetGary Paulsen,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hatchet/summary.html,"Brian Robeson, a thirteen-year-old from New York City, boards a plan headed from Hampton, New York to the Canadian north woods to visit his father. His parents' recent divorce weighs heavily on him, as does ""The Secret"" that his mother is having an affair. The pilot gives him a very brief flying lesson in which Brian has control of the plane for a few minutes. The pilot seems to be experiencing increasing pain in his shoulder, arm, and stomach. At first Brian does not think it is very serious, but as the pilot begins jerking in his seat it becomes clear that he is having a heart attack. The attack stops and the pilot is dead; Brian is forced to take over the controls. After a harrowing descent, the plane crashes into a lake in the Canadian woods, where Brian is stranded."
HatchetGary Paulsen,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hatchet/summary.html,"Brian soon catches his first fish and enjoys a big feast. That night, however, a skunk enters the shelter and when Brian yells at the skunk, it sprays him, temporarily blinding him and covering him with a horrible stench. Brian perfects his tools and catches a foolbird, his first meat. While he is cleaning the bird in the water, a moose attacks Brian, injuring his ribs and his shoulder. Another unfortunate incident soon follows when a tornado sweeps over the woods and destroys Brian's shelter."
HatchetGary Paulsen,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hatchet/summary.html,"The day after the tornado, Brian discovers that the chaotic storm has riled up the water in the lake, and the tail of the plane had emerged from the lake, reminding Brian of the dead pilot and compelling him to say a few words for him. Lying in bed one night, it occurs to Brian that he could seek out the survival pack in the body of the plane, and he determines to build a raft to do so. After many incidents of trial-and-error, Brian retrieves the survival pack from the plane. At one point he drops the hatchet to the lake's bottom, but retrieves it with a long dive. On his way back up to the surface, Brian sees the dead pilot's head underwater, partially eaten by fish. Brian gets sick in the water but manages to make it back to his shelter to get some sleep."

He finds some strange berries to eat, which make him extremely sick. He then finds a raspberry patch, where he spots a bear. Brian constructs a shelter and in the middle of the night he hears a noise. A porcupine has entered his shelter and Brian throws the hatchet in its direction. It shoots its quills into Brian's leg, causing him severe pain. Brian attempts to build a fire with no matches and eventually succeeds when he learns how to strike his hatchet against a stone to ignite sparks. He finds turtle eggs and eagerly eats them. One day a plane flies overhead but does not see him and continues on its way, leaving Brian devastated and hopeless.

"Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters’ First 100 YearsDelany, Delany, Hearth",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/havingoursay/summary.html,"Having Our Say is an oral history conducted
by Amy Hill Hearth with the centenarian sisters Sadie and Bessie Delany. The book is divided into a preface and seven parts. In the
preface, Hearth describes how the Delanys first charm her when she
writes about them for the New York Times and how
she eventually convinces them to share their stories in a book.
After the preface, Hearth disappears from the narrative. She provides
context for the Delanys’ stories at the beginning of each section
but otherwise acts strictly as a listener. When the sisters tell
a story together, or in an almost identical fashion, Hearth attributes
the chapters to them both. When the sisters have distinctive viewpoints
or ways of telling a story, Hearth attributes the chapter to either
Bessie or Sadie. Though the book’s seven parts generally follow
a chronological pattern, the sisters occasionally discuss the present
day (the early 1990s).
They compare different eras of history; make judgments with their
century of experience; and frequently discuss racism, sexism, and
aging."
"Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters’ First 100 YearsDelany, Delany, Hearth",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/havingoursay/summary.html,"Sadie and Bessie encounter racism early in life. The Jim
Crow laws throughout the South required separate facilities for
whites and blacks, and on the trolley to Pullen Park, a driver tells
the Delany family to sit in the back. The spring where they drink
water at the park is divided, with one side for whites and the other
for blacks, and the drugstore where they used to buy limeade will
no longer serve them. Despite all the obstacles, all the Delany
children plan to go to college. To pay for school, both Sadie and
Bessie take jobs as teachers. Sadie is a Jeanes Supervisor, setting
up domestic science programs in rural schools, and she takes Booker
T. Washington on tours of her school district. Bessie teaches first
in rural North Carolina, then in Georgia. In Georgia, she is nearly
lynched on her way to her new job when she stands up to a drunken
white man in a train station waiting room. Both women date, but
their father is critical of their beaux, and Nanny tells Bessie
that she will have to choose between work and a family."
"Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters’ First 100 YearsDelany, Delany, Hearth",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/havingoursay/summary.html,"During World War II, the Delany sisters are concerned
with their nephew, Little Hubie. Little Hubie is born “damaged”
(which is the extent of the explanation the sisters give for his
condition) and dies when he is ten years old. Manross Delany fights
in the war and faces discrimination in the U.S. armed forces. Sadie,
Bessie, and their mother move to a cottage in the Bronx and enjoy
cultivating their own garden. Nanny is too elderly to stay home
by herself, so Bessie retires at fifty-nine to take care of her.
Before she dies, Nanny meets Eleanor Roosevelt. Around this time,
the civil rights movement is underway, and the Jim Crow laws at
last begin to unravel. The deaths of their mother and a number of
their brothers grieve the sisters. They decide to move to Mount
Vernon, a mostly white suburb in New York. At their advanced age,
the Delany sisters are part of a quiet revolutionary movement to
integrate white suburbs. Sadie and Bessie discuss aging and the
fears and fearlessness that accompany that process."
"Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters’ First 100 YearsDelany, Delany, Hearth",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/havingoursay/summary.html,"Throughout the stories, the sisters talk about their childhoods
in the segregated South, where the “rebby boys,” or racist white
men, are a constant menace. The sisters have very different personalities. Sadie
is an obedient mama’s child, and Bessie is strong-willed and outspoken.
Both sisters are determined and intelligent. The sisters describe
their parents, Henry Beard Delany and Nanny James Logan, who grew
up during and after the Civil War. Following the “Surrender” came
the difficult days of the Reconstruction, when poverty and a struggle
for power ruled the South. Henry was born into slavery. When the
Surrender came, his family began a free life with nothing. The Delanys
were luckier than most black families because they were together
and they could read. Nanny’s family faced discrimination because
her father was white and her mother was a quarter black. Though
Nanny appeared white, she was considered “colored,” and her own
parents couldn’t marry. Nanny and Henry met at Saint Augustine’s
School in Raleigh, North Carolina, and Henry eventually became vice
principal of “Saint Aug’s.” The Delany parents had ten children,
including Sadie and Bessie."
"Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters’ First 100 YearsDelany, Delany, Hearth",http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/havingoursay/summary.html,"Sadie moves to Harlem in 1916,
and Bessie follows nearly two years later. All the Delany children
except Lemuel eventually migrate to Harlem. The Harlem Renaissance,
a time of literary experimentation and cutting-edge jazz music,
is in full swing. Although they sometimes go to nightclubs and know
many famous personalities through their brother Hubert, a New York
City political figure, the sisters focus on their careers. Sadie
attends Pratt Institute, then Columbia University, where she receives
a master’s degree. She becomes the first black woman to teach domestic
science at public high schools in New York City. Bessie studies
dentistry at Columbia University and opens a practice in Harlem.
She shares an office with her brother Hap, and the place becomes
a meeting point for thinkers such as E. Franklin Frazier. Bessie
narrowly avoids an encounter with the Ku Klux Klan on Long Island
and becomes an outspoken protestor against racial discrimination.
The family is devastated when Henry Beard Delany dies in 1928.
Nanny moves to Harlem and begins to go on trips with Sadie. The
black community is particularly hard-hit by the Depression, but
the Delanys cope."
Heart of Darkness,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart/summary.html,"Marlow and his crew come across a hut with stacked firewood, together
with a note saying that the wood is for them but that they should
approach cautiously. Shortly after the steamer has taken on the
firewood, it is surrounded by a dense fog. When the fog clears, the
ship is attacked by an unseen band of natives, who fire arrows from
the safety of the forest. The African helmsman is killed before Marlow
frightens the natives away with the ship’s steam whistle. Not long
after, Marlow and his companions arrive at Kurtz’s Inner Station,
expecting to find him dead, but a half-crazed Russian trader, who
meets them as they come ashore, assures them that everything is
fine and informs them that he is the one who left the wood. The
Russian claims that Kurtz has enlarged his mind and cannot be subjected
to the same moral judgments as normal people. Apparently, Kurtz
has established himself as a god with the natives and has gone on
brutal raids in the surrounding territory in search of ivory. The
collection of severed heads adorning the fence posts around the
station attests to his “methods.” The pilgrims bring Kurtz out of
the station-house on a stretcher, and a large group of native warriors
pours out of the forest and surrounds them. Kurtz speaks to them,
and the natives disappear into the woods."
Heart of Darkness,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart/summary.html,"Heart of Darkness centers
around Marlow, an introspective sailor, and his journey up the Congo
River to meet Kurtz, reputed to be an idealistic man of great abilities.
Marlow takes a job as a riverboat captain with the Company, a Belgian
concern organized to trade in the Congo. As he travels to Africa
and then up the Congo, Marlow encounters widespread inefficiency
and brutality in the Company’s stations. The native inhabitants
of the region have been forced into the Company’s service, and they
suffer terribly from overwork and ill treatment at the hands of
the Company’s agents. The cruelty and squalor of imperial enterprise
contrasts sharply with the impassive and majestic jungle that surrounds
the white man’s settlements, making them appear to be tiny islands
amidst a vast darkness."
Heart of Darkness,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart/summary.html,"The manager brings Kurtz, who is quite ill, aboard the
steamer. A beautiful native woman, apparently Kurtz’s mistress,
appears on the shore and stares out at the ship. The Russian implies
that she is somehow involved with Kurtz and has caused trouble before through
her influence over him. The Russian reveals to Marlow, after swearing
him to secrecy, that Kurtz had ordered the attack on the steamer
to make them believe he was dead in order that they might turn back
and leave him to his plans. The Russian then leaves by canoe, fearing
the displeasure of the manager. Kurtz disappears in the night, and
Marlow goes out in search of him, finding him crawling on all fours
toward the native camp. Marlow stops him and convinces him to return
to the ship. They set off down the river the next morning, but Kurtz’s
health is failing fast."
Heart of Darkness,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart/summary.html,"Marlow listens to Kurtz talk while he pilots the ship,
and Kurtz entrusts Marlow with a packet of personal documents, including
an eloquent pamphlet on civilizing the savages which ends with a scrawled
message that says, “Exterminate all the brutes!” The steamer breaks
down, and they have to stop for repairs. Kurtz dies, uttering his
last words—“The horror! The horror!”—in the presence of the confused
Marlow. Marlow falls ill soon after and barely survives. Eventually
he returns to Europe and goes to see Kurtz’s Intended (his fiancée).
She is still in mourning, even though it has been over a year since
Kurtz’s death, and she praises him as a paragon of virtue and achievement.
She asks what his last words were, but Marlow cannot bring himself
to shatter her illusions with the truth. Instead, he tells her that
Kurtz’s last word was her name."
Heart of Darkness,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heart/summary.html,"Marlow arrives at the Central Station, run by the general
manager, an unwholesome, conspiratorial character. He finds that
his steamship has been sunk and spends several months waiting for parts
to repair it. His interest in Kurtz grows during this period. The manager
and his favorite, the brickmaker, seem to fear Kurtz as a threat
to their position. Kurtz is rumored to be ill, making the delays in
repairing the ship all the more costly. Marlow eventually gets the parts
he needs to repair his ship, and he and the manager set out with a
few agents (whom Marlow calls pilgrims because of their strange habit
of carrying long, wooden staves wherever they go) and a crew of
cannibals on a long, difficult voyage up the river. The dense jungle and
the oppressive silence make everyone aboard a little jumpy, and the
occasional glimpse of a native village or the sound of drums works
the pilgrims into a frenzy."
Hedda Gabler,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heddagabler/summary.html,"Act 3 begins just before dawn, with Mrs. Elvsted sitting up, still waiting for Ejlert to return. Hedda is asleep on the couch. Soon, she awakes and sends Mrs. Elvsted in to sleep on her bed. Tesman arrives and tells his wife that he has possession of Ejlert's fabulous manuscript, which Ejlert dropped while walking home drunk. Tesman plans to return it to him but is called away, hearing that his Aunt Rina is dying. Brack arrives and tells Hedda that Tesman left before Ejlert got into real trouble, that indeed he has been arrested. Brack leaves, and Ejlert arrives. He tells a shocked Mrs. Elvsted that he has destroyed his manuscript. She is crushed and leaves immediately. Then, Ejlert confesses to Hedda that he has, in fact, lost the manuscript and that he wants to kill himself. Hedda does not tell him she has the manuscript; she simply gives him one of her pistols and tells him to have a beautiful death. He leaves, and she burns the manuscript, referring to it as the child of Ejlert and Mrs. Elvsted."
Hedda Gabler,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heddagabler/summary.html,"When Brack returns later that day, in Act 2, he finds Hedda playing with her pistols, out of boredom. They talk privately for a while and agree that they should form a close, personal bond. Hedda tells Brack how bored she was on her honeymoon and how she has no special feeling for the house Tesman has gone to great lengths to buy for her, under the false impression that she desperately wanted to live there. Soon, Tesman arrives and talk turns to the stag party that Brack is throwing later that night. Ejlert Lövborg arrives and talks in earnest with Hedda while Tesman and Brack drink in the other room. Then, Mrs. Elvsted arrives. Hedda plays Ejlert and Mrs. Elvsted against each other, making Ejlert think the other was worried he would begin drinking again. At this hint, he begins to drink and decides to join Tesman and Brack as they leave for the party. Mrs. Elvsted is very upset, but Ejlert promises to return in a few hours to escort her home."
Hedda Gabler,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heddagabler/summary.html,"Act 4 begins with the living room in darkness. Aunt Julle arrives. Everyone is wearing black as a sign of mourning. We soon learn through dialogue, however, that it is Aunt Rina whose death they mourn: Aunt Julle announces that she must find another invalid to take care of now. She leaves. Mrs. Elvsted arrives, reporting to have heard that Ejlert is in the hospital. Brack arrives and confirms this but reports to the company that Ejlert is, in fact, already dead, having wounded himself in the chest. Tesman and Mrs. Elvsted immediately sit down to try to reconstruct his manuscript in honor of his death, based on notes Mrs. Elvsted has kept. In private, Brack tells Hedda that it was actually an ugly death, that the pistol went off accidentally, and that scandal might ensue for Hedda. Hedda leaves the room and, after playing the piano for some moments, shoots herself."
Hedda Gabler,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/heddagabler/summary.html,"The entire play takes place in the Tesman's living room and in a smaller room to its side. Jürgen Tesman and Hedda Tesman (nee Hedda Gabler) are newlyweds. They have just returned from a six-month honeymoon. Hedda is aristocratic and hard to please. Throughout the play, it becomes apparent that Hedda is pregnant. At the beginning of Act 1, Tesman wakes to find his Aunt Julle has arrived for a visit. Aunt Julle raised Tesman and still supports him financially. When Hedda enters, however, she is rather rude to Aunt Julle. Tesman asks her to be kinder, but she clearly has little real interest in him either. Soon, Mrs. Elvsted arrives, bringing news that Tesman's old academic rival, Ejlert Lövborg, is back in town. Lövborg had been an alcoholic and a failure, but now he has reformed. Eventually, Hedda gets Tesman to leave, and she convinces Mrs. Elvsted to confide in her. She learns that Mrs. Elvsted is scared Ejlert will start drinking again and also that she has come to look for him without her husband's permission. Mrs. Elvsted leaves and Judge Brack arrives. Judge Brack brings gossip from town, most notably that Ejlert is quite a success and may be poised to take the position at the university that Tesman is counting on getting himself. He leaves, and Tesman tells Hedda that they will have to cut back on their expenses."

He departs; the other lords discuss how they shall come up with an excuse to kill Gloucester.

Left alone onstage, York revels in the turn of events; all he had lacked was an army and now he has one.

HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"At first, the men are unable to discover any of the inhabitants, but soon they
notice three young women watching them from the trees. The men make several attempts
to entice them to come closer but have little luck, although the women obviously
find the men interesting. Terry uses a necklace to draw one of the women closer,
then makes a grab for her. The women flee, showing amazing athleticism. The men give
chase but are soon left behind. The men follow them into the nearest settlement,
where they are greeted by a large gathering of women. The women are unlike any the
men have ever encountered: strong, self-confident, clearly intelligent, and
obviously unafraid of men. The women indicate that they want the men to follow them,
but the three friends are unwilling to be taken into custody. The men decide to make
a break for it, but they are soon overcome by the women, who drug them into
unconsciousness."
HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"The men awake to find themselves unharmed but captive. The women treat the men
well and begin to teach them their language, although the men are still not allowed
to roam freely. After a while, the men, especially Terry, become impatient and
decide to attempt an escape. They fashion a crude rope and lower themselves to the
ground outside their window. From there, the men sneak back toward their airplane,
hiding themselves carefully during the day. When they find the airplane, the men
also encounter the three young women they met upon their arrival: Celis, Alima, and
Ellador. The men begin talking to the women and become so distracted that they are
soon recaptured. Back in custody, the men learn that their escape attempt
had been anticipated and that they had, in fact, been observed the whole
time."
HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"The women of Herland are themselves concerned about their lack of men, feeling
that their society would benefit from a masculine perspective and contribution.
Accordingly, Celis, Alima, and Ellador are encouraged to continue the courtship the
men had so crudely begun upon their first arrival. The primary obstacle the lovers
have to overcome is the assumption, by the men, that theirs is the active, dominant
role in the relationship. The young women see themselves as equal partners with the
men and cannot understand why the men would want it any other way. Jeff is a
romantic, full of chivalry and southern notions of gallantry, and his tendency to
put women on a pedestal sometimes becomes condescending and hampers his relationship
with Celis. Jeff is, however, the most ardent convert to the ways of Herland. Terry,
in contrast, woos Alima in a brusque, aggressive way, convinced that she desires a
“masterful” man and that all men should have a submissive mate. Alima is fascinated
by Terry, but wary; the two quarrel and make up often. Van and Ellador have the
best, most equal relationship, soon becoming best friends and true lovers. The
entire society of Herland watches the three couples with great interest, seeing that
the outcome of the experiment could determine the future of Herland and mark their
return to a “bi-sexual” state."
HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"Now resigned to their gentle captivity, the men begin to question their tutors
about the history and organization of what they have come to call
“Herland.” They are told that Herland has been without men for 2,000
years, ever since a sequence of wars, natural disasters, and internal strife
combined to leave a small population of women alone atop their hidden plateau.
Forced to fend for themselves under extreme circumstances, the women organized their
society along the most rational lines possible, realizing that they would never
survive without cooperation. After a time, a young girl miraculously became
pregnant, and her descendants (each of whom was female, and each of whom inherited
the gift of solo reproduction) are the present inhabitants of Herland. Over time,
the women of Herland developed a peaceful, orderly, highly efficient society in
which competition, crime, and antisocial behavior are unknown. As befits a society
of mothers, childbearing is the greatest honor of the women’s lives, as well as
their highest duty. In fact, Herland is essentially a giant family, an organic
community pursuing the common good. As such, property is held in common, there is a
loose system of authority based on experience and wisdom, and the wellbeing and
education of children are the highest priorities."
HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"Terry’s sexual advances become more aggressive and even brutal, and Alima is
forced to defend herself physically. The leaders of Herland are shocked by Terry’s
attempted rape of Alima and decide to exile the men. Celis is now pregnant, much to
the joy of the Herlanders, and so Jeff decides to stay behind with her forever.
Terry is more than pleased to leave Herland behind. Though he threatens at first to
return in force, he eventually promises to keep the location of the plateau a
secret. Ellador decides to accompany Van in order to see the outer world in his
company and to report back on what she observes to Herland. Taking the airplane on
which the men first arrived, Terry, Van, and Ellador return to the troubled world
below."
HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"At the insistence of the men, a marriage ceremony is arranged for the three
couples. After the wedding, the women are uncomfortable with the idea of “private
life,” preferring to remain part of the larger community. They are also confused by
the notion of nonprocreative sexual activity. The men respond to this new challenge
in different ways. Jeff is a thorough believer in the superiority of Herland. Van
wants to find some way to combine the best aspects of companionate marriage as he
understands it, including romantic and sexual intimacy, with the socially minded
attitude of Herland, in which the needs of the larger group always prevail. Ellador
shares this desire, feeling romantic love for Van along with her familial desire to
procreate for the community. Terry is outraged by Alima’s continued insistence on
her own autonomy, feeling that he now “owns” Alima by marriage."
HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"Three adventurous friends—Vandyck Jennings (the narrator, also called Van),
Terry Nicholson, and Jeff Margrave—join a scientific expedition to one of
the few remaining uncharted areas of the world, although Van leaves the exact
region ambiguous as he tells the story. As they travel, the friends hear
persistent rumors of a strange land, hidden high in the mountains,
that is populated only by women. Intrigued, the men investigate the rumors
and do, in fact, find evidence of an advanced, isolated culture in the mountains,
cut off from the rest of the world. Doubtful about the existence of an all-female
country, the men are nevertheless excited by the chance to explore an unknown land,
and they resolve to return on their own to find it. The three are driven by a
genuine desire for knowledge, a love of adventure, and, although Van is
ashamed to admit it, by fantasies stoked by the tales they have heard
of a land full of women without men."
HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"As the men, especially Van and Jeff, come to learn about and appreciate the
social structure of Herland, the women begin to learn, through the men, about the
outside world. All three men begin with the assumption that any comparison of
Herland and the “civilized” world of Europe and the United States will be to the
advantage of the latter. Van and Jeff, however, soon realize that, in comparison to
the society they have left behind, Herland is a veritable paradise. The women of
Herland are shocked to hear of the poverty, disease, exploitation, and violence of
the modern world, so much so that the men find themselves dissembling out of shame
and often hiding the full truth. The women are able to perceive the true nature of
the society the men describe, despite their reticence: women are particularly
exploited in the competitive, money-driven modern world, as their maternal function
is used to keep them in a subordinate position. The women are horrified to learn of
the practice of abortion, for example, seeing it as violence against motherhood
itself. The more Van and Jeff see of Herland, the more they are convinced of its
goodness and of the fundamental sickness of their own society. Terry, however,
refuses to see anything good in Herland apart from the beauty of its inhabitants.
Terry is convinced that women are naturally subordinate to men and that women, in
fact, desire to be “mastered” by men. The very existence of Herland is an affront to
Terry’s sensibilities, and the more he learns of it, the more he resents the
“unnatural” state of affairs."
HerlandCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/herland/summary.html,"The friends equip an expedition back to the hidden plateau and begin to survey
the area using Terry’s airplane. From the air, they see signs of an advanced
civilization and decide to land. As they explore the hidden country, the men notice
the obvious cultivation of the forests and the great skill with which the roads have
been laid. Terry takes these signs of agricultural and technological skill as
evidence that there must be men around after all."

The girl remarks that the nearby hills look like white elephants, to which the American responds that he’s never seen one. They order more drinks and begin to bicker about the taste of the alcohol. The American chastises her and says that they should try to enjoy themselves. The girl replies that she’s merely having fun and then retracts her earlier comment by saying the hills don’t actually look like white elephants to her anymore."

The American then claims that he won’t force her to have the operation but thinks it’s the best course of action to take.

HiroshimaJohn Hersey,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hiroshima/summary.html,"On August 6, 1945, the
American army decimates the city of Hiroshima with a bomb of enormous
power; out of a population of 250,000, the
bomb kills nearly 100,000 people and injures 100,000 more.
In its original edition, Hersey’s Hiroshima traces
the lives of six survivors—two doctors, two women, and two religious
men—from the moment the bomb drops until a few months later. In 1985,
Hersey added a postscript that now forms the book’s fifth chapter.
In this chapter, Hersey reexamines these six individuals’ lives
in the forty years since the bomb."
HiroshimaJohn Hersey,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hiroshima/summary.html,"Miss Toshiko Sasaki is a young clerk whose leg is fractured
in the blast. Her wound becomes terribly infected, and she receives
no real medical help for weeks after the explosion. The bomb kills
more than half the doctors in Hiroshima and injures most of the
rest; Dr. Masakazu Fujii, for instance, is unable to help anybody
but himself for a long while. Dr. Terufumi Sasaki, on the other
hand, remains the only uninjured doctor on the staff of the Red
Cross Hospital, and in the months after the explosion he barely
leaves his post, trying to stem the tide of death rising around
him."
HiroshimaJohn Hersey,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hiroshima/summary.html,"The Reverend Mr. Kiyoshi Tanimoto, a community leader
and an American-educated Methodist pastor, is uninjured by the explosion.
As fires spread around the city, he helps get people to safety at a
small park on the outskirts of the city. Tanimoto is aided by Father Wilhelm Kleinsorge, a Jesuit priest. Despite his own illness, Father Kleinsorge
consoles the wounded and brings water to those who need it. Many
of the victims are too weak or wounded to move, and in the absence
of any official help, people like Father Kleinsorge and Mr. Tanimoto
are left to protect them from encroaching fires, whirlwinds, and
the rising tide of the river. Among the victims they help are Mrs. Hatsuyo Nakamura and her young children."
HiroshimaJohn Hersey,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hiroshima/summary.html,"Weeks after the explosion, after Japan capitulates and Hiroshima
begins to rebuild, a new terror strikes: radiation sickness. Victims
become nauseated, feverish, and anemic; many people, such as Mrs.
Nakamura, watch their hair fall out. The disease baffles everyone,
and many, including Father Kleinsorge, never fully recover. Still,
the people of Hiroshima try to return to their normal lives. In
his added postscript, Hersey traces the lives of these six characters
in the forty years after the atomic bomb. Father Kleinsorge and
Dr. Fujii die from sudden illnesses years later. Mrs. Nakamura and
Miss Sasaki scrape their way up from the bottom to become happy
and successful. After working hard and supporting her family, Mrs.
Nakamura lives comfortably on a pension and a government allowance,
and Miss Sasaki becomes a nun. Dr. Sasaki and Mr. Tanimoto devote
their lives to helping people. Mr. Tanimoto in particular plays
an important role in trying to help the victims of the bomb—most
notably the Hiroshima Maidens, whose burns are so bad that they
require plastic surgery. He becomes a minor celebrity in America
and somewhat unsuccessfully tries to spread a message of peace in
a time of nuclear escalation."
HiroshimaJohn Hersey,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hiroshima/summary.html,"In the end, Hersey finds that the horrors of nuclear
war are far from over—the citizens of Hiroshima still suffer from
aftereffects, and nuclear escalation continues to threaten the entire
world. Hersey also finds that these six people show, in the aftermath
of the bomb and the war, remarkable feelings of good will, reconciliation, and
pride."

Stanley knows that the Warden, who happens to be a descendent of Charles and Linda Walker, is interested in this find and he speculates that perhaps Kate Barlow used to live in the area. The other boys at the camp are tough and all have nicknames. Stanley tries to stay in the good graces of X-Ray, the obvious leader of the group but this becomes harder as Stanley becomes better friends with a boy named Zero. Although Stanley and Zero, also known as Hector Zeroni, do not know it, Hector is the great- great-great-grandson of Madame Zeroni. Zero eventually runs away from camp and Stanley, in an effort to save him, follows after a few days. The two help each other to reach the top of a big mountain, which turns out to be Sam's old onion field. Because Zero is very weak, Stanley carries him up this mountain. They survive on onions for more than a week and then return to camp, planning to search for Kate Barlow's treasure in the hole where Stanley found the lipstick tube."
HomecomingCynthia Voigt,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/homecoming/summary.html,"That night, Dicey finds her grandmother writing a letter to Eunice in the kitchen. She takes this opportunity to explain to Dicey the reasons she cannot take the children in: she has little money and no income, she cherishes the freedom and independence she gained when her stern husband died four years ago, and she is afraid of repeating the mistakes she made as a mother that drove her children away. Dicey's grandmother admits to Dicey, however, that she likes the children and wants them to stay. The next morning, their grandmother seems to remember little of her proclamation of the night before, and several days later, she takes the children to town to register for school, explaining that it may take weeks for Eunice to write back to her letter, expressing whether she will take the children back. At school, Maybeth passes a test allowing her to study in the third grade, much to the joy of all her family members. As they are preparing to return home, Dicey realizes her grandmother has forgotten to mail the letter to Eunice. She reminds her grandmother of the letter, but before she can get to the letterbox, Dicey stops her, telling her that she should take the children in, even if she does not want to. To her surprise, her grandmother agrees, stating in mock exasperation that the children have worn her down. Overjoyed, the five return home together, united in their sense of hope and relief."
HomecomingCynthia Voigt,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/homecoming/summary.html,"One day in early summer, Dicey Tillerman's mother begins a trip with her children in their battered station wagon to see their Aunt Cilla in Bridgeport, Connecticut. When they have driven about half the distance between their home in Provincetown and Bridgeport, Momma stops the car and gets out, telling the three younger children, James, Maybeth, and Sammy to mind Dicey. Their Momma does not return, and the next day the children, under Dicey's determined leadership, set out to walk to Bridgeport, with only a map, a change of underwear, and seven dollars. The children walk for days on end, buying food as cheaply as possible, scrounging for change alongside of the road, and sleeping in or near empty houses. After several days, they stop to rest in a state park, where clams, mussels, and fish abound, and they meet a young runaway couple, Edie and Louis. In the park, Sammy, to Dicey's dismay, steals both food and money, and they leave in a fright when the police begin looking for them."
HomecomingCynthia Voigt,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/homecoming/summary.html,"The children find that Aunt Cilla is dead, and their fussy and pious cousin, Eunice, occupies the house alone. Eunice takes the children in, and soon the three younger children are attending a church camp every day while Dicey helps Eunice care for the house. Dicey also begins to earn money by washing windows around town. In Bridgeport, Dicey talks to the police about Momma's disappearance, and before long, the police have located her: she is comatose in a mental hospital in Boston. The Tillerman children are unhappy in Bridgeport. Sammy gets in fights, upsetting Eunice, the nuns want to label Maybeth as retarded and give her special schooling, and Dicey feels the children growing apart from one another. When Eunice decides to give up her dream of becoming a nun and adopt the children—although she still considers handing the belligerent Sammy over to the state—Dicey acts quickly. While in Bridgeport, they have learned of their grandmother, Abigail Tillerman, who lives in Crisfield, Maryland, and Dicey decides they must meet her."

The children find their belligerent and eccentric grandmother on a run-down farm seven miles outside of town. The grandmother agrees to let them stay the night, but adamantly refuses to let them stay for good. Dicey and the others, however, start to fall in love with their grandmother's beautiful farm on the shore, and Dicey has found an old sailboat in the barn, which she is determined to use. The children decide that they will start doing work around the farm, postponing their departure one day at a time until their grandmother gets used to them. The children work diligently for about five days, until Will pays a visit, bringing the children used bicycles as a gift. That night, however, their grandmother explodes when Sammy rides off without permission and Dicey refuses to allow their grandmother to punish him by sending him to bed without supper.

In Annapolis, they convince two boys, Tom and Jerry to sail them across the bay, and during the trip, Dicey falls in love with sailing. Once across, Dicey, determined to save money for a possible return trip, decides they must walk again. They find a circus and befriend the proprietor, Will. After a couple of days, they see signs advertising work picking tomatoes, and Dicey and the children approach a local farmer, Rudyard, asking for work. The children sense the man's untrustworthiness, but work through the morning. By the time evening comes, they are sure the man means them harm, and when he pulls up in his truck, they dash away into the night, crossing a nearby river. He pursues, but soon gives up his chase.

That night, James steals twenty dollars from their benefactors, which he grudgingly returns the next morning.

he accused her of being frigid. She was hurt by this but later realized that
he was just a jerk. She later married a man she thought she loved,
John, though at a certain point they had problems communicating.
Like Rudy, he did not understand her Dominican cultural heritage,
and could not appreciate the Spanish language. When Yolanda stopped
trusting and loving John, she could not understand the words he
used, and only heard ""babble, babble."" She had a mental breakdown
at her parents' house, in which she could only quote and misquote
bits of things she had read and heard throughout her life. She spent

proud community by explaining that black students are expected to
become only athletes or servants. When Maya gets a rotten tooth,
Momma takes her to the only dentist in Stamps, a white
man who insults her, saying he’d rather place his hand in a dog’s mouth

master Spanish. Immediately upon arriving in Guatemala City, however, she
understands the discrimination that exists for people of her heritage. At
the landowner’s home, even the dog is treated better than she. The most
influential force in Rigoberta’s life as she figures out the various
household tasks is Candelaria. Like Rigoberta, Candelaria is an Indian, yet
she has learned to speak Spanish and dresses as a ladino. She has also
figured out how to get under the mistress’s skin and routinely sabotages her by
neglecting certain chores and talking back. When Rigoberta’s father comes to the
mistress’s house and asks for money, Candelaria convinces the mistress to
contribute. Rigoberta doesn’t follow in Candelaria’s footsteps right away, but
Candelaria’s rebellious spirit has an impact on her that continues even after
Candelaria is booted out of the house."

In Our TimeErnest Hemingway,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/inourtime/summary.html,"In Our Time is a collection of short stories and vignettes about the years before, during, and after World War I. The stories, which are titled, are separated by vignettes, each of which is a chapter. The first story, ""On the Quai at Smyrna,"" introduces the war through a description of an evacuation. Then, ""Indian Camp,"" ""The Doctor and the Doctor's Wife,"" ""The End of Something,"" ""The Three-Day Blow,"" ""The Battler"" and perhaps ""A Very Short Story"" all describe an encounter in the life of Nick Adams. Through these stories, Nick seems to be growing up. The vignettes are scenes from war, in which few characters are named. Chapter VI, after ""The Battler,"" is about Nick in the war. After that, the vignettes turn away from stories of the war and the short stories take up a different subject."

Then, ""Big Two-Hearted River,"" parts I and II, are about the return of Nick Adams to his fishing ground, the forest around which and town of which have been burnt down. The vignettes that separate these stories vary in content but mostly deal with bullfighting. The final vignette, ""L'Envoi,"" is a surreal story about a visit to a Greek king."
Incidents in the Life of a Slave GirlHarriet Jacobs,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/incidents/summary.html,"When she discovers that Benny and Ellen are to receive similar treatment,
Linda hatches a desperate plan. Escaping to the North with two small children would
be impossible. Unwilling to submit to Dr. Flint’s abuse, but equally unwilling to
abandon her family, she hides in the attic crawl space in the house of her
grandmother, Aunt Martha. She hopes that Dr. Flint, under the false impression that
she has gone North, will sell her children rather than risk having them disappear as
well. Linda is overjoyed when Dr. Flint sells Benny and Ellen to a slave trader who
is secretly representing Mr. Sands. Mr. Sands promises to free the children one day
and sends them to live with Aunt Martha. But Linda’s triumph comes at a high price.
The longer she stays in her tiny garret, where she can neither sit nor stand, the
more physically debilitated she becomes. Her only pleasure is to watch her children
through a tiny peephole, as she cannot risk letting them know where she is. Mr.
Sands marries and becomes a congressman. He brings Ellen to Washington, D.C., to
look after his newborn daughter, and Linda realizes that Mr. Sands may never free
her children. Worried that he will eventually sell them to slave traders, she
determines that she must somehow flee with them to the North. However, Dr. Flint
continues to hunt for her, and escape remains too risky."
Incidents in the Life of a Slave GirlHarriet Jacobs,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/incidents/summary.html,"Emily Flint and her husband, Mr. Dodge, arrive in New York to capture Linda.
Linda goes into hiding, and the new Mrs. Bruce offers to purchase her freedom. Linda
refuses, unwilling to be bought and sold yet again, and makes plans to follow Benny
to California. Mrs. Bruce buys Linda anyway. Linda is devastated at being sold and
furious with Emily Flint and the whole slave system. However, she says she remains
grateful to Mrs. Bruce, who is still her employer when she writes the book. She
notes that she still has not yet realized her dream of making a home for herself and
her children to share. The book closes with two testimonials to its accuracy, one
from Amy Post, a white abolitionist, and the other from George W. Lowther, a black
antislavery writer."

Benny remains with Aunt Martha, and Linda is reunited with Ellen, who is now nine
years old and living in Brooklyn, New York. Linda is dismayed to find that her
daughter is still held in virtual slavery by Mr. Sands’s cousin, Mrs. Hobbs. She
fears that Mrs. Hobbs will take Ellen back to the South, putting her beyond Linda’s
reach forever. She finds work as a nursemaid for a New York City family, the Bruces,
who treat her very kindly. Dr. Flint continues to pursue Linda, and she flees to
Boston. There, she is reunited with Benny. Dr. Flint now claims that the sale of
Benny and Ellen was illegitimate, and Linda is terrified that he will re-enslave all
of them. After a few years, Mrs. Bruce dies, and Linda spends some time living with
her children in Boston. She spends a year in England caring for Mr. Bruce’s
daughter, and for the first time in her life she enjoys freedom from racial
prejudice. When Linda returns to Boston, Ellen goes to boarding school and Benny
moves to California with Linda’s brother William. Mr. Bruce remarries, and Linda
takes a position caring for their new baby. Dr. Flint dies, but his daughter, Emily,
writes to Linda to claim ownership of her. The Fugitive Slave Act is passed by

which the author, Harriet Jacobs, states her reasons for writing an autobiography.
Her story is painful, and she would rather have kept it private, but she feels that
making it public may help the antislavery movement. A preface by abolitionist Lydia
Maria Child makes a similar case for the book and states that the events it records
are true."
Incidents in the Life of a Slave GirlHarriet Jacobs,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/incidents/summary.html,"Jacobs uses the pseudonym Linda Brent to narrate her first-person account.
Born into slavery, Linda spends her early years in a happy home with her mother and
father, who are relatively well-off slaves. When her mother dies, six-year-old Linda
is sent to live with her mother’s mistress, who treats her well and teaches her to
read. After a few years, this mistress dies and bequeaths Linda to a relative. Her
new masters are cruel and neglectful, and Dr. Flint, the father, soon begins
pressuring Linda to have a sexual relationship with him. Linda struggles against
Flint’s overtures for several years. He pressures and threatens her, and she defies
and outwits him. Knowing that Flint will eventually get his way, Linda consents to a
love affair with a white neighbor, Mr. Sands, saying that she is ashamed of this
illicit relationship but finds it preferable to being raped by the loathsome Dr.
Flint. With Mr. Sands, she has two children, Benny and Ellen. Linda argues that a
powerless slave girl cannot be held to the same standards of morality as a free
woman. She also has practical reasons for agreeing to the affair: she hopes that
when Flint finds out about it, he will sell her to Sands in disgust. Instead, the
vengeful Flint sends Linda to his plantation to be broken in as a field hand."
InfernoDante Alighieri,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/inferno/summary.html,"In the Third Circle of Hell, the Gluttonous must lie in
mud and endure a rain of filth and excrement. In the Fourth Circle,
the Avaricious and the Prodigal are made to charge at one another
with giant boulders. The Fifth Circle of Hell contains the river
Styx, a swampy, fetid cesspool in which the Wrathful spend
eternity struggling with one another; the Sullen lie bound beneath
the Styx’s waters, choking on the mud. Dante glimpses Filippo Argenti,
a former political enemy of his, and watches in delight as other
souls tear the man to pieces."
InfernoDante Alighieri,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/inferno/summary.html,"Virgil and Dante next proceed to the walls of the city
of Dis, a city contained within the larger region of Hell. The demons
who guard the gates refuse to open them for Virgil, and an angelic
messenger arrives from Heaven to force the gates open before Dante.
The Sixth Circle of Hell houses the Heretics, and there Dante encounters
a rival political leader named Farinata. A deep valley leads into
the First Ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell, where those who were
violent toward others spend eternity in a river of boiling blood.
Virgil and Dante meet a group of Centaurs, creatures who are half
man, half horse. One of them, Nessus, takes them into the Second
Ring of the Seventh Circle of Hell, where they encounter those who
were violent toward themselves (the Suicides). These souls must
endure eternity in the form of trees. Dante there speaks with Pier
della Vigna. Going deeper into the Seventh Circle of Hell, the travelers find
those who were violent toward God (the Blasphemers); Dante meets
his old patron, Brunetto Latini, walking among the souls of those
who were violent toward Nature (the Sodomites) on a desert of burning
sand. They also encounter the Usurers, those who were violent toward
Art."
InfernoDante Alighieri,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/inferno/summary.html,"Virgil leads Dante through the gates of Hell, marked by
the haunting inscription “abandon all hope, you who enter here”
(III.7). They enter the outlying region of
Hell, the Ante-Inferno, where the souls who in life could not commit
to either good or evil now must run in a futile chase after a blank
banner, day after day, while hornets bite them and worms lap their
blood. Dante witnesses their suffering with repugnance and pity.
The ferryman Charon then takes him and his guide across the river
Acheron, the real border of Hell. The First Circle of Hell, Limbo,
houses pagans, including Virgil and many of the other great writers
and poets of antiquity, who died without knowing of Christ. After
meeting Horace, Ovid, and Lucan, Dante continues into the Second
Circle of Hell, reserved for the sin of Lust. At the border of the
Second Circle, the monster Minos lurks, assigning condemned souls
to their punishments. He curls his tail around himself a certain
number of times, indicating the number of the circle to which the
soul must go. Inside the Second Circle, Dante watches as the souls
of the Lustful swirl about in a terrible storm; Dante meets Francesca,
who tells him the story of her doomed love affair with Paolo da
Rimini, her husband’s brother; the relationship has landed both
in Hell."
InfernoDante Alighieri,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/inferno/summary.html,"A huge, mist-shrouded form lurks ahead, and Dante approaches it.
It is the three-headed giant Lucifer, plunged waist-deep into the ice.
His body pierces the center of the Earth, where he fell when God hurled
him down from Heaven. Each of Lucifer’s mouths chews one of history’s
three greatest sinners: Judas, the betrayer of Christ, and Cassius
and Brutus, the betrayers of Julius Caesar. Virgil leads Dante on
a climb down Lucifer’s massive form, holding on to his frozen tufts
of hair. Eventually, the poets reach the Lethe, the river of forgetfulness,
and travel from there out of Hell and back onto Earth. They emerge
from Hell on Easter morning, just before sunrise."

to an eternity among those guilty of Spiritual Theft (the False
Counselors) for his role in executing the ruse of the Trojan Horse.
In the Ninth Pouch, the souls of Sowers of Scandal and Schism walk
in a circle, constantly afflicted by wounds that open and close
repeatedly. In the Tenth Pouch, the Falsifiers suffer from horrible
plagues and diseases."
InfernoDante Alighieri,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/inferno/summary.html,"The monster Geryon transports Virgil and Dante
across a great abyss to the Eighth Circle of Hell, known as Malebolge,
or “evil pockets” (or “pouches”); the term refers to the circle’s
division into various pockets separated by great folds of earth.
In the First Pouch, the Panderers and the Seducers receive lashings
from whips; in the second, the Flatterers must lie in a river of
human feces. The Simoniacs in the Third Pouch hang upside down in
baptismal fonts while their feet burn with fire. In the Fourth Pouch
are the Astrologists or Diviners, forced to walk with their heads
on backward, a sight that moves Dante to great pity. In the Fifth
Pouch, the Barrators (those who accepted bribes) steep in pitch
while demons tear them apart. The Hypocrites in the Sixth Pouch
must forever walk in circles, wearing heavy robes made of lead. Caiphas,
the priest who confirmed Jesus’ death sentence, lies crucified on
the ground; the other sinners tread on him as they walk. In the
horrifying Seventh Pouch, the Thieves sit trapped in a pit of vipers,
becoming vipers themselves when bitten; to regain their form, they
must bite another thief in turn."
InfernoDante Alighieri,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/inferno/summary.html,"Inferno opens on the
evening of Good Friday in the year 1300. Traveling
through a dark wood, Dante Alighieri has lost his path and now wanders
fearfully through the forest. The sun shines down on a mountain
above him, and he attempts to climb up to it but finds his way blocked
by three beasts—a leopard, a lion, and a she-wolf. Frightened and
helpless, Dante returns to the dark wood. Here he encounters the
ghost of Virgil, the great Roman poet, who has come to guide Dante
back to his path, to the top of the mountain. Virgil says that their
path will take them through Hell and that they will eventually reach
Heaven, where Dante’s beloved Beatrice awaits. He adds that it was
Beatrice, along with two other holy women, who, seeing Dante lost
in the wood, sent Virgil to guide him."
InfernoDante Alighieri,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/inferno/summary.html,"Virgil and Dante proceed to the Ninth Circle of Hell through
the Giants’ Well, which leads to a massive drop to Cocytus, a great
frozen lake. The giant Antaeus picks Virgil and Dante up and sets
them down at the bottom of the well, in the lowest region of Hell.
In Caina, the First Ring of the Ninth Circle of Hell, those who
betrayed their kin stand frozen up to their necks in the lake’s
ice. In Antenora, the Second Ring, those who betrayed their country
and party stand frozen up to their heads; here Dante meets Count
Ugolino, who spends eternity gnawing on the head of the man who
imprisoned him in life. In Ptolomea, the Third Ring, those who betrayed
their guests spend eternity lying on their backs in the frozen lake,
their tears making blocks of ice over their eyes. Dante next follows
Virgil into Judecca, the Fourth Ring of the Ninth Circle of Hell
and the lowest depth. Here, those who betrayed their benefactors
spend eternity in complete icy submersion."

He does, and Mr. Das takes their picture together. Mrs. Das gets Mr. Kapasi’s address so that she can send him a copy of the picture, and Mr. Kapasi begins to daydream about how they will have a great correspondence that will, in a way, finally fulfill his dreams of being a diplomat between countries.

Mrs. Das remarks that his job is romantic and asks him to tell her about some of his patients. However, Mr. Kapasi views his job as a failure. At one time, he had been a scholar of many languages, and now he remains fluent only in English. He took the interpreting job as a way to pay the medical bills when his eldest son contracted typhoid and died at age seven. He kept the job because the pay was better than his previous teaching job, but it reminds his wife of their son’s death.

Into the WildJon Krakauer,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/into-the-wild/summary.html,"Jon Krakauer’s own trip to Denali National Park and the abandoned bus where McCandless died closes out the narrative. Along with three experienced Alaskans, Krakauer crosses the same river whose flooding prevented McCandless from leaving the wild. The four hikers encounter the bus in the late evening and examine its contents. Everything seems to have been as McCandless left it. The party eats dinner and reflects on the circumstances that could have led McCandless to head into the wild. In an epilogue, the author visits the bus again with Walt and Billie McCandless, Christopher McCandless’s mother and father."

Jim Gallien reads about the finding of the corpse and then contacts the police, setting off a string of events that lead to the identification of the body. Krakauer next visits with McCandless’s family, beginning with his father, Walt McCandless, and his mother, Billie McCandless. Billie shows Krakauer photographs of Christopher’s childhood and Walt describes the heartbreak his son has caused the family. Krakauer’s investigation then picks up a new subject: McCandless’s frustration with his family. When McCandless graduated from high school, he went on a trip to California and discovered that his father had been a bigamist. Krakauer theorizes that McCandless’s anger at this long-kept family secret offers some motivation for his desire to leave his life behind."
Into the WildJon Krakauer,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/into-the-wild/summary.html,"Into the Wild begins with the discovery of Christopher McCandless’s body by a group of Alaskan hunters who visit Denali National Park and Preserve on a yearly excursion. They radio for help. The FBI arrives and removes the body. Krakauer then visits with Wayne Westerberg, who knew Christopher McCandless as “Alex McCandless” and who provides an initial character sketch of the young man, Krakauer in a bar in Carthage, Wisconsin. Westerberg employed McCandless on and off on his grain elevator and remembers him as engaging, intelligent, and determined. Details from McCandless’s comfortable, middle-class Virginia upbringing and his dislike of materialism further Krakauer’s understanding of the young man. These same details take the narrator back to the first leg of McCandless’s journey west in his used yellow Datsun."
Into the WildJon Krakauer,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/into-the-wild/summary.html,"Into the Wild contains two interconnected plots, one that involves directly represented action and another that involves the careful development of a psychological portrait of Christopher McCandless. The first plot tracks McCandless’s journey into the wild, while the second tracks the development of Krakauer’s, and, implicitly, the reader’s, understanding of McCandless’s character and motivations. Neither plot is presented in linear fashion, and the two often intersect through the presentation of subtle detail, description, and the elaboration of multiple possible lines of cause and effect. Krakauer serves as the narrator throughout the book."
Into the WildJon Krakauer,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/into-the-wild/summary.html,"Krakauer then dedicates two chapters to his own ascent of the Devils Thumb. These parallel the plot of McCandless’s journey. Krakauer attempts the glacier’s north face and is rebuffed, then spends three days trapped at his base camp. After accidentally setting his tent on fire, he makes a desperate attempt at the southeast face and succeeds. Recalling this story allows Krakauer conclude that Christopher McCandless must not have been suicidal when he began his trip."

In the meantime, the McCandless family begins investigating their son’s disappearance. After his canoeing excursion, McCandless lives and works in Bullhead City, Arizona. An old man named Charlie takes him in briefly, before McCandless departs and meets Jan Buress and her old boyfriend in California. He engages in the social life of Buress’s drifters’ camp but leaves hastily, intending to embark on his trip to Alaska. Krakauer receives a letter from and then meets Ronald Franz, who describes to Krakauer the father-son relationship he established with McCandless. The narrator uses Franz’s story to initiate a line of investigation into the harm McCandless’s risk-taking behavior caused others."
Into the WildJon Krakauer,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/into-the-wild/summary.html,"Krakauer next visits Wayne Westerberg again and reconstructs McCandless’s last month in Carthage, South Dakota by speaking with Westerberg’s girlfriend and his mother. He acquires insight into McCandless’s troubled relationship with his father and relates that in late April, 1992, McCandless sent his friends postcards revealing that he was leaving for the wild, perhaps never to return. Krakauer’s investigation then move through his revelation that many readers of his original Outdoor magazine article about McCandless thought that Christopher McCandless was an incompetent, romantic fool. In response, Krakauer embarks on the telling of the stories of three other twentieth century wilderness fanatics who disappeared or died in the wild. He evaluates each and decides that McCandless has the most in common the young artist Everett Ruess."

a prestigious black college, but only after humiliating him by forcing
him to fight in a “battle royal” in which he is pitted against other
young black men, all blindfolded, in a boxing ring. After the battle
royal, the white men force the youths to scramble over an electrified

meets Emerson’s son, who opens the letter and tells the narrator that
he has been betrayed: the letters from Bledsoe actually portray the
narrator as dishonorable and unreliable. The young Emerson helps
the narrator to get a low-paying job at the Liberty Paints plant, whose
trademark color is “Optic White.” The narrator briefly serves as
an assistant to Lucius Brockway, the black man who makes this white

IvanhoeSir Walter Scott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ivanhoe/summary.html,"At Templestowe, the stronghold of the Knights-Templars, de Bois-Guilbert comes under fire from his commanders for bringing a Jew into their sacred fortress. It is speculated among the Templars that perhaps Rebecca is a sorceress who has enchanted de Bois-Guilbert against his will; the Grand Master of the Templars concurs and orders a trial for Rebecca. On the advice of de Bois-Guilbert, who has fallen in love with her, Rebecca demands a trial-by-combat, and can do nothing but await a hero to defend her. To his dismay, de Bois-Guilbert is appointed to fight for the Templars: if he wins, Rebecca will be killed, and if he loses, he himself will die. At the last moment, Ivanhoe appears to defend Rebecca, but he is so exhausted from the journey that de Bois-Guilbert unseats him in the first pass. But Ivanhoe wins a strange victory when de Bois-Guilbert falls dead from his horse, killed by his own conflicting passions."
IvanhoeSir Walter Scott,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ivanhoe/summary.html,"It is a dark time for England. Four generations after the Norman conquest of the island, the tensions between Saxons and Normans are at a peak; the two peoples even refuse to speak one another's languages. King Richard is in an Austrian prison after having been captured on his way home from the Crusades; his avaricious brother, Prince John, sits on the throne, and under his reign the Norman nobles have begun routinely abusing their power. Saxon lands are capriciously repossessed, and many Saxon landowners are made into serfs. These practices have enraged the Saxon nobility, particularly the fiery Cedric of Rotherwood. Cedric is so loyal to the Saxon cause that he has disinherited his son Ivanhoe for following King Richard to war. Additionally, Ivanhoe fell in love with Cedric's high-born ward Rowena, whom Cedric intends to marry to Athelstane, a descendent of a long-dead Saxon king. Cedric hopes that the union will reawaken the Saxon royal line."

With the party are Cedric, Rowena, and Athelstane, as well as Isaac and Rebecca, a Jewish father and daughter who have been tending to Ivanhoe after his injury, and Ivanhoe himself. De Bracy attempts to convince Rowena to marry him, while de Bois-Guilbert attempts to seduce Rebecca, who has fallen in love with Ivanhoe. Both men fail, and the castle is attacked by a force led by the Black Knight who helped Ivanhoe at the tournament. Fighting with the Black Knight are the legendary outlaws of the forest, Robin Hood and his merry men. The villains are defeated and the prisoners are freed, but de Bois-Guilbert succeeds in kidnapping Rebecca. As the battle winds down, Ulrica, a Saxon crone, lights the castle on fire, and it burns to the ground, engulfing both Ulrica and Front-de-Boeuf."

The narrator shows the connections between the characters, focusing on the perspectives and experiences of individuals and sometimes allowing them to narrate their stories in their own words. Golden Gray, the mixed race child of a white woman, Vera Louise, and a black slave, Henry LesTroy, was raised by his mother and True Belle in Baltimore. He believed all his life that he was a white adopted orphan, but when True Belle told him the truth about his father, he set out for Virginia to confront Henry LesTroy. When he arrived near Vienna, Virginia, Golden Gray spotted Wild hiding alongside the road. When she turned quickly and knocked herself unconscious, he decided to take her with him to his father's home. Wild was very pregnant and gave birth to Joe when they arrived at Henry LesTroy's house. Golden Gray never returned to Baltimore after this incident but lived with Wild in the woods, totally apart from civilization.

Violet grew up in a poor household in Virginia with her mother Rose Dear. Her grandmother, True Belle, came from Baltimore to live with them when Violet's father abandoned the family. Soon afterwards Violet's mother, Rose Dear, committed suicide by throwing herself into a well. Joe also grew up in Virginia. He was orphaned at birth and raised by adoptive parents. As a young man he wondered about his birth mother's identity and tied on several occasions to find her. His mentor, a hunter named Henry LesTroy and called ""Hunters Hunter,"" hinted to Joe that his mother was the local mystery, a crazy homeless rover named Wild. When Joe finally tracked Wild down in the woods he asked her to confirm somehow that she was indeed his mother. Wild responded with a hand gesture that Joe could not make out, leaving him to question his own identity. Joe and Violet met in a town called Palestine where they were working the fields.

Joe and Dorcas meet when Joe comes to Dorcas's aunt's house to sell ladies cosmetics, and their affair lasts from October of 1925 to the first of January 1926.

intending to eat him, Richard Parker kills him. Not long after,
the boat pulls up to a strange island of trees that grow directly
out of vegetation, without any soil. Pi and Richard Parker stay
here for a time, sleeping in their boat and exploring the island
during the day. Pi discovers a huge colony of meerkats who sleep
in the trees and freshwater ponds. One day, Pi finds human teeth
in a tree’s fruit and comes to the conclusion that the island eats
people. He and Richard Parker head back out to sea, finally washing
ashore on a Mexican beach. Richard Parker runs off, and villagers

Long Day's Journey into NightEugene O'Neill,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/longdays/summary.html,"The play is set in the summer home of the Tyrone family, August 1912. The action begins in the morning, just after breakfast. We learn as the first act unravels that Mary has returned to her family recently after receiving treatment in a sanatorium for morphine addiction. Edmund, meanwhile, has in recent weeks begun to cough very violently, and we learn later on in the play that, as Tyrone and Jamie suspect, he has tuberculosis. Throughout the course of the play, we slowly find out that Mary is still addicted to morphine, much to the disappointment of her family members."
Long Day's Journey into NightEugene O'Neill,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/longdays/summary.html,"Most of the plot of the play is repetitious, just as the cycle of an alcoholic is repetitious. The above arguments occur numerous times throughout the four acts and five scenes. All acts are set in the living room, and all scenes but the last occur either just before or just after a meal. Act II, Scene i is set before lunch; scene ii after lunch; and Act III before dinner. Each act focuses on interplay between two specific characters: Act I features Mary and Tyrone; Act II Tyrone and Jamie, and Edmund and Mary; Act III Mary and Jamie; Act IV Tyrone and Edmund, and Edmund and Jamie."
Long Day's Journey into NightEugene O'Neill,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/longdays/summary.html,"The repetitious plot also helps develop the notion that this day is not remarkable in many ways. Instead, it is one in a long string of similar days for the Tyrones, filled with bitterness, fighting, and an underlying love."
Long Day's Journey into NightEugene O'Neill,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/longdays/summary.html,"The gradual revelation of these two medical disasters makes up most of the play's plot. In between these discoveries, however, the family constantly revisits old fights and opens old wounds left by the past, which the family members are never unable to forget. Tyrone, for example, is constantly blamed for his own stinginess, which may have led to Mary's morphine addiction when he refused to pay for a good doctor to treat the pain caused by childbirth. Mary, on the other hand, is never able to let go of the past or admit to the painful truth of the present, the truth that she is addicted to morphine and her youngest son has tuberculosis. They all argue over Jamie and Edmund's failure to become successes as their father had always hoped they would become. As the day wears on, the men drink more and more, until they are on the verge of passing out in Act IV."

Julian quickly learns that twentieth-century society is vastly different from that of the nineteenth century. The economy is based on publicly owned capital rather than private, as was the case in Julian's day. The government controls the means of production and divides the national product equally between all citizens. Every citizen receives a college-level education. Individuals are given a great deal of freedom in choosing a career, and everyone retires at the age of forty-five. Society is based on an ideal of the brotherhood of man, and it is unthinkable that any individual should suffer the evils of poverty or hunger. With Doctor Leete's guidance, Julian comes to understand and appreciate the twentieth-century society.

Jim is a promising young man who goes to sea as a youth. He rises quickly through the ranks and soon becomes chief mate. Raised on popular sea literature, Jim constantly daydreams about becoming a hero, yet he has never faced any real danger. Finally, his chance comes. He is serving aboard a vessel called the Patna, carrying Muslim pilgrims to Mecca, when the ship strikes an underwater object and springs a leak. With a storm approaching, the crew abandons her and her passengers to their fate. Jim, not thinking clearly, abandons the ship with the rest of the crew. The Patna does not sink, however, and Jim, along with the rest of the officers, is subjected to an official inquiry by his fellow seamen. It is at this inquiry, where Jim is stripped of his officer's certification, that he first meets Marlow."

Jim, unaware of the plot, agrees to let Brown leave the area peacefully (Brown guesses at Jim's dishonorable past, and Jim decides it would be still more dishonorable to kill Brown simply because Brown knows the truth about him). Cornelius guides Brown down an alternate river channel, which leads him to the camp of Dain Waris, the son of Jim's closest ally, Doramin. Brown and his men ambush the camp, killing Dain Waris. Jim, realizing that he has still not been able to escape his initial failure aboard the Patna, ignores Jewel's pleas and goes to Doramin's compound, where the grieving father shoots and kills him."

While the men are fully distracted by Peace, Lysistrata lectures them on the need for reconciliation between the states of Greece. Lysistrata reasons that because both Athens and Sparta are of a common heritage and because they have previously helped one another and owe a debt to one another, the two sides should not be fighting. Using Peace as a map of Greece, the Spartan and Athenian leaders decide land rights that will end the war. After both sides agree, Lysistrata gives the women back to the men and a great celebration ensues.

LysistrataAristophanes,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/lysistrata/summary.html,"In Lysistrata there are two choruses—the Chorus of Old Men and the Chorus of Old Women. A Koryphaios leads both choruses. The Chorus of Men is first to appear on stage carrying wood and fire to the gates of the Akropolis. The Chorus of Men is an old and bedraggled bunch of men who have great difficulty with the wood and the great earthen pots of fire they carry. The men plan to smoke the women out of the Akropolis. The Chorus of Old Women also approaches the Akropolis, carrying jugs of water to put out the men's fires. The Chorus of Old Women is victorious in the contest between the choruses and triumphantly pours the jugs of water over the heads of the men. The Commissioner, an appointed magistrate, comes to the Akropolis seeking funds for the naval ships. The Commissioner is surprised to find the women at the Akropolis and orders his policemen to arrest Lysistrata and the other women. In a humorous battle, that involves little physical contact, the policemen are scared off. The Commissioner takes the opportunity to tell the men of Athens that they have been too generous and allowed too much freedom with the women of the city. As the policemen run off, the Commissioner and Lysistrata are left to argue about the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata argues that the War is a concern for women especially and she adds her two cents as to how the city should be run, drawing an elaborate analogy to show that Athens should be structured as a woman would spin wool. Lysistrata tells the Commissioner that war is a concern of women because women have sacrificed greatly for it—women have given their husbands and their sons to the effort. Lysistrata adds that it is now difficult for a woman to find a husband. The women mockingly dress the Commissioner as a woman."

Emma is often indiscreet, and the townspeople all gossip about her.
Charles, however, suspects nothing. His adoration for his wife and

throws herself even more passionately into her affair with Rodolphe.
She borrows money to buy him gifts and suggests that they run off
together and take little Berthe with them. Soon enough, though,
the jaded and worldly Rodolphe has grown bored of Emma’s demanding
affections. Refusing to elope with her, he leaves her. Heartbroken,
Emma grows desperately ill and nearly dies."

old romantic flame between Emma and Leon, and this time the two
embark on a love affair. As Emma continues sneaking off to Rouen
to meet Leon, she also grows deeper and deeper in debt to the moneylender
Lheureux, who lends her more and more money at exaggerated interest

Maggie: A Girl of the StreetsStephen Crane,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/maggie/summary.html,"The linear narrative now ceases, and we are given a series of scenes, arranged in chronological order but separated by passages of time. There is an interlude in which we see that Jimmie, who acts horrified at Maggie's actions, has in fact himself seduced and then abandoned at least one girl. In another brief scene, Maggie visits Pete at work, and he, too, refuses to acknowledge her legitimate claims on him. Months later, we are shown a prostitute--presumably Maggie, but unnamed--walking the streets of New York, pathetic and rejected, bound for trouble. There is a scene with Pete in a bar, badly drunk and surrounded by women; he collapses on the floor and, in his turn, is abandoned by the scornful and manipulative Nellie. Finally, the novel ends with Jimmie giving Mary the news that Maggie's dead body has been found. Mary stages a scene of melodramatic mourning for her ruined child, which ends with her deeply hypocritical and bitterly ironic concession: ""I'll fergive her!"""

Jimmie and Mary affect sorrow and bewilderment at Maggie's fall from grace, and her behavior becomes a neighborhood scandal. A scant few weeks after Maggie leaves home, she is in a bar with Pete when they meet Nellie, a scheming woman with a veneer of sophistication who has no trouble convincing Pete to leave Maggie.

Maggie, by contrast, seems somehow immune to the corrupting influence of abject poverty; underneath the grime, she is physically beautiful and, even more surprising, both hopeful and naïve. When Pete--now a bartender--makes his return to the scene, he entrances Maggie with his bravado and show of bourgeois trappings. Pete senses easy prey, and they begin dating; she is taken--and taken in--by his relative worldliness and his ostentatious displays of confidence.

Ostensibly, the gifts are meant to convince Glauce to ask her father to allow the children to stay in Corinth. The coronet and dress are actually poisoned, however, and their delivery causes Glauce's death. Seeing his daughter ravaged by the poison, Creon chooses to die by her side by dramatically embracing her and absorbing the poison himself."
MedeaEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medea/summary.html,"Fearing a possible plot of revenge, Creon banishes Medea and her children from the city. After pleading for mercy, Medea is granted one day before she must leave, during which she plans to complete her quest for ""justice""--at this stage in her thinking, the murder of Creon, Glauce, and Jason. Jason accuses Medea of overreacting. By voicing her grievances so publicly, she has endangered her life and that of their children. He claims that his decision to remarry was in everyone's best interest. Medea finds him spineless, and she refuses to accept his token offers of help."
MedeaEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medea/summary.html,"Outside the royal palace, a nurse laments the events that have lead to the present crisis. After a long series of trials and adventures, which ultimately forced Jason and Medea to seek exile in Corinth, the pair had settled down and established their family, achieving a degree of fame and respectability. Jason's recent abandonment of that family has crushed Medea emotionally, to the degree that she curses her own existence, as well as that of her two children."
MedeaEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medea/summary.html,"A messenger recounts the gruesome details of these deaths, which Medea absorbs with cool attentiveness. Her earlier state of anxiety, which intensified as she struggled with the decision to commit infanticide, has now given way to an assured determination to fulfill her plans. Against the protests of the chorus, Medea murders her children and flees the scene in a dragon-pulled chariot provided by her grandfather, the Sun-God. Jason is left cursing his lot; his hope of advancing his station by abandoning Medea and marrying Glauce, the conflict which opened the play, has been annihilated, and everything he values has been lost through the deaths that conclude the tragedy."
MedeaEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/medea/summary.html,"Appearing by chance in Corinth, Aegeus, King of Athens, offers Medea sanctuary in his home city in exchange for her knowledge of certain drugs that can cure his sterility. Now guaranteed an eventual haven in Athens, Medea has cleared all obstacles to completing her revenge, a plan which grows to include the murder of her own children; the pain their loss will cause her does not outweigh the satisfaction she will feel in making Jason suffer."

They had come near the Galapagos Islands, and the woman's husband and her brother had wanted to stay at one of the islands and collect valuable tortoise oil. The French captain agreed to drop them off with some supplies, and then to pick them up on his return trip four months later.

MiddlemarchGeorge Eliot,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/middlemarch/summary.html,"Two major life choices govern the narrative of Middlemarch. One
is marriage and the other is vocation. Eliot takes both choices very
seriously. Short, romantic courtships lead to trouble, because both
parties entertain unrealistic ideals of each other. They marry without
getting to know one another. Marriages based on compatibility work
better. Moreover, marriages in which women have a greater say also
work better, such as the marriage between Fred and Mary. She tells
him she will not marry if he becomes a clergyman. Her condition
saves Fred from an unhappy entrapment in an occupation he doesn't
like. Dorothea and Casaubon struggle continually because Casaubon
attempts to make her submit to his control. The same applies in
the marriage between Lydgate and Rosamond."
MiddlemarchGeorge Eliot,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/middlemarch/summary.html,"Middlemarch is a highly unusual novel.
Although it is primarily a Victorian novel, it has many characteristics
typical to modern novels. Critical reaction to Eliot's masterpiece
work was mixed. A common accusation leveled against it was its morbid,
depressing tone. Many critics did not like Eliot's habit of scattering
obscure literary and scientific allusions throughout the book. In
their opinion a woman writer should not be so intellectual. Eliot
hated the ""silly, women novelists."" In the Victorian era, women
writers were generally confined to writing the stereotypical fantasies
of the conventional romance fiction. Not only did Eliot dislike
the constraints imposed on women's writing, she disliked the stories
they were expected to produce. Her disdain for the tropes of conventional romance
is apparent in her treatment of marriage between Rosamond and Lydgate.
Both and Rosamond and Lydgate think of courtship and romance in
terms of ideals taken directly from conventional romance. Another
problem with such fiction is that marriage marks the end of the
novel. Eliot goes through great effort to depict the realities of
marriage."
MiddlemarchGeorge Eliot,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/middlemarch/summary.html,"Middlemarch stubbornly refuses to behave
like a typical novel. The novel is a collection of relationships
between several major players in the drama, but no single one person
occupies the center of the action. No one person can represent provincial
life. It is necessary to include multiple people. Eliot's book is
fairly experimental for its time in form and content, particularly
because she was a woman writer."
MiddlemarchGeorge Eliot,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/middlemarch/summary.html,"Eliot's refusal to conform to happy endings demonstrates
the fact that Middlemarch is not meant to be entertainment.
She wants to deal with real-life issues, not the fantasy world to
which women writers were often confined. Her ambition was to create
a portrait of the complexity of ordinary human life: quiet tragedies,
petty character failings, small triumphs, and quiet moments of dignity.
The complexity of her portrait of provincial society is reflected
in the complexity of individual characters. The contradictions in
the character of the individual person are evident in the shifting
sympathies of the reader. One moment, we pity Casaubon, the next
we judge him critically."
MiddlemarchGeorge Eliot,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/middlemarch/summary.html,"Moreover, Eliot's many critics found Middlemarch to
be too depressing for a woman writer. Eliot refused to bow to the
conventions of a happy ending. An ill-advised marriage between two
people who are inherently incompatible never becomes completely harmonious.
In fact, it becomes a yoke. Such is the case in the marriages of
Lydgate and Dorothea. Dorothea was saved from living with her mistake
for her whole life because her elderly husband dies of a heart attack.
Lydgate and Rosamond, on the other hand, married young."
MiddlemarchGeorge Eliot,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/middlemarch/summary.html,"The choice of an occupation by which one earns a living
is also an important element in the book. Eliot illustrates the
consequences of making the wrong choice. She also details at great
length the consequences of confining women to the domestic sphere
alone. Dorothea's passionate ambition for social reform is never
realized. She ends with a happy marriage, but there is some sense
that her end as merely a wife and mother is a waste. Rosamond's
shrewd capabilities degenerate into vanity and manipulation. She
is restless within the domestic sphere, and her stifled ambitions
only result in unhappiness for herself and her husband."

the thirty-first anniversary of India’s independence. Saleem prophesies
that he will die on that day, disintegrating into millions of specks
of dust."
Midnight's ChildrenSalman Rushdie,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midnightschildren/summary.html,"Because it occurs at the exact moment India gains its
independence, the press heralds Saleem’s birth as hugely significant.
Young Saleem has an enormous cucumberlike nose and blue eyes like
those of his grandfather, Aadam Aziz. His mischievous sister, nicknamed the
Brass Monkey, is born a few years later. Overwhelmed by the expectations
laid on him by the prophecy, and ridiculed by other children for
his huge nose, Saleem takes to hiding in a washing chest. While
hiding one day, he sees his mother sitting down on the toilet; when
Amina discovers him, she punishes Saleem to one day of silence.
Unable to speak, he hears, for the first time, a babble of voices
in his head. He realizes he has the power of telepathy and can enter
anyone’s thoughts. Eventually, Saleem begins to hear the thoughts
of other children born during the first hour of independence. The
1,001 midnight’s children—a number reduced to 581 by their tenth
birthday—all have magical powers, which vary according to how close
to midnight they were born. Saleem discovers that Shiva, the boy
with whom he was switched at birth, was born with a pair of enormous,
powerful knees and a gift for combat."
Midnight's ChildrenSalman Rushdie,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midnightschildren/summary.html,"Saleem Sinai, the narrator of Midnight’s Children,
opens the novel by explaining that he was born on midnight, August
15, 1947, at the exact moment India gained its independence from
British rule. Now nearing his thirty-first birthday, Saleem believes
that his body is beginning to crack and fall apart. Fearing that
his death is imminent, he grows anxious to tell his life story.
Padma, his loyal and loving companion, serves as his patient, often
skeptical audience."
Midnight's ChildrenSalman Rushdie,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midnightschildren/summary.html,"One day, Saleem loses a portion of his finger in an accident
and is rushed to the hospital, where his parents learn that according
to Saleem’s blood type, he couldn’t possibly be their biological
son. After he leaves the hospital, Saleem is sent to live with his
Uncle Hanif and Aunt Pia for a while. Shortly after Saleem returns
home to his parents, Hanif commits suicide. While the family mourns
Hanif’s death, Mary confesses to having switched Saleem and Shiva
at birth. Ahmed—now an alcoholic—grows violent with Amina, prompting her
to take Saleem and the Brass Monkey to Pakistan, where she moves
in with Emerald. In Pakistan, Saleem watches as Emerald’s husband,
General Zulfikar, stages a coup against the Pakistani government
and ushers in a period of martial law."
Midnight's ChildrenSalman Rushdie,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midnightschildren/summary.html,"Four years later, after Ahmed suffers a heart failure,
Amina and the children move back to Bombay. India goes to war with
China, while Saleem’s perpetually congested nose undergoes a medical operation.
As a result, he loses his telepathic powers but, in return, gains
an incredible sense of smell, with which he can detect emotions."
Midnight's ChildrenSalman Rushdie,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midnightschildren/summary.html,"Saleem’s entire family moves to Pakistan after India’s
military loss to China. His younger sister, now known as Jamila
Singer, becomes the most famous singer in Pakistan. Already on the
brink of ruin, Saleem’s entire family—save Jamila and himself—dies
in the span of a single day during the war between India and Pakistan. During
the air raids, Saleem gets hit in the head by his grandfather’s silver
spittoon, which erases his memory entirely."
Midnight's ChildrenSalman Rushdie,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midnightschildren/summary.html,"Relieved of his memory, Saleem is reduced to an animalistic
state. He finds himself conscripted into military service, as his
keen sense of smell makes him an excellent tracker. Though he doesn’t
know exactly how he came to join the army, he suspects that Jamila
sent him there as a punishment for having fallen in love with her.
While in the army, Saleem helps quell the independence movement
in Bangladesh. After witnessing a number of atrocities, however,
he flees into the jungle with three of his fellow soldiers. In the
jungle of the Sundarbans, he regains all of his memory except the
knowledge of his name. After leaving the jungle, Saleem finds Parvati-the-witch,
one of midnight’s children, who reminds him of his name and helps
him escape back to India. He lives with her in the magician’s ghetto,
along with a snake charmer named Picture Singh."
Midnight's ChildrenSalman Rushdie,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/midnightschildren/summary.html,"Saleem’s story begins in Kashmir, thirty-two years before
his birth, in 1915. There, Saleem’s grandfather, a doctor named
Aadam Aziz, begins treating Naseem, the woman who becomes Saleem’s grandmother.
For the first three years Aadam Aziz treats her, Naseem is always
covered by a sheet with a small hole in it that is moved to expose
the part of her that is sick. Aadam Azis sees his future wife’s
face for the first time on the same day World War I ends, in 1918.
Aadam Aziz and Naseem marry, and the couple moves to Agra, where
Aadam—a doctor whose loss of religious faith has affected him deeply—sees
how protests in the name of independence get violently suppressed.
Aadam and Naseem have three daughters, Alia, Mumtaz, and Emerald,
and two sons, Mustapha and Hanif. Aadam becomes a follower of the
optimistic activist Mian Abdullah, whose anti-Partition stance eventually
leads to his assassination. Following Abdullah’s death, Aadam hides
Abdullah’s frightened assistant, Nadir Khan, despite his wife’s
opposition. While living in the basement, Nadir Khan falls in love
with Mumtaz, and the two are secretly married. However, after two
years of marriage, Aadam finds out that his daughter is still a
virgin, as Nadir and Mumtaz have yet to consummate their marriage.
Nadir Khan is sent running for his life when Mumtaz’s sister, Emerald,
tells Major Zulfikar—an officer in the Pakistani army, soon to be
Emerald’s husband—about his hiding place in the house. Abandoned
by her husband, Mumtaz agrees to marry Ahmed Sinai, a young merchant who
until then had been courting her sister, Alia."

Julie points out that he needs capital to open a hotel, and she has not a penny to her name. Jean says that in that case, the plans are off.

In the process of telling Allison’s story, John Krakauer gives key background information on the city of Missoula. He describes the importance of football to the local culture and the privileges given to football players in the town. Beau and Allison are long time family friends who consider each other like brother and sister. In September of 2010, after a night of heavy drinking and partying at Beau’s house, Allison wakes up to find Beau raping her. Allison goes to the hospital to have a rape kit collected. The next day, her trauma is reawakened when she sees Beau on the sidelines of a UM football game. Allison’s friend, Keely Williams, supports her and convinces her to see if she can get Beau to admit to his crime. Beau does, and Allison struggles with whether or not she should report him to the police. After fifteen months, Allison decides reporting Beau is the only way to get him to take full responsibility for his actions."

They are worried he will not argue convincingly for the maximum sentence, thirty years in the state prison with twenty years suspended. Responding to mounting pressure from the media and an ongoing investigation by the U.S. Department of Justice into the way rape is being handled in Missoula, Fred Van Valkenberg agrees to argue Allison’s case. At the hearing, Beau’s witnesses find it difficult to argue that he should not be punished, and the judge gives Beau the maximum sentence, thirty years in the state prison with twenty years suspended.

for their oil. From time to time, the ship encounters other whaling
vessels. Ahab always demands information about Moby Dick from their
captains. One of the ships, the Jeroboam, carries
Gabriel, a crazed prophet who predicts doom for anyone who threatens
Moby Dick. His predictions seem to carry some weight, as those aboard
his ship who have hunted the whale have met disaster. While
trying to drain the oil from the head of a captured sperm whale,
Tashtego, one of the Pequod’s harpooners, falls
into the whale’s voluminous head, which then rips free of the ship

several more whales. Issuing a prophecy about Ahab’s death, Fedallah declares
that Ahab will first see two hearses, the second of which will be
made only from American wood, and that he will be killed by hemp
rope. Ahab interprets these words to mean that he will not die at
sea, where there are no hearses and no hangings. A typhoon hits the Pequod, illuminating
it with electrical fire. Ahab takes this occurrence as a sign of
imminent confrontation and success, but Starbuck, the ship’s first
mate, takes it as a bad omen and considers killing Ahab to end the
mad quest. After the storm ends, one of the sailors falls from the

Moby-DickHerman Melville,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mobydick/summary.html,"During another whale hunt, Pip, the Pequod’s
black cabin boy, jumps from a whaleboat and is left behind in the
middle of the ocean. He goes insane as the result of the experience
and becomes a crazy but prophetic jester for the ship. Soon after,
the Pequod meets the Samuel Enderby, a
whaling ship whose skipper, Captain Boomer, has lost an arm in an
encounter with Moby Dick. The two captains discuss the whale; Boomer,
happy simply to have survived his encounter, cannot understand Ahab’s
lust for vengeance. Not long after, Queequeg falls ill and has the
ship’s carpenter make him a coffin in anticipation of his death.
He recovers, however, and the coffin eventually becomes the Pequod’s
replacement life buoy."
Moby-DickHerman Melville,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mobydick/summary.html,"On the third day, the boats are once again sent after
Moby Dick, who once again attacks them. The men can see Fedallah’s
corpse lashed to the whale by the harpoon line. Moby Dick rams the Pequod and
sinks it. Ahab is then caught in a harpoon line and hurled out of
his harpoon boat to his death. All of the remaining whaleboats and
men are caught in the vortex created by the sinking Pequod and
pulled under to their deaths. Ishmael, who was thrown from a boat
at the beginning of the chase, was far enough away to escape the
whirlpool, and he alone survives. He floats atop Queequeg’s coffin,
which popped back up from the wreck, until he is picked up by the Rachel, which
is still searching for the crewmen lost in her earlier encounter
with Moby Dick."
Moby-DickHerman Melville,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mobydick/summary.html,"The Pequod leaves Nantucket on a cold
Christmas Day with a crew made up of men from many different countries
and races. Soon the ship is in warmer waters, and Ahab makes his
first appearance on deck, balancing gingerly on his false leg, which
is made from a sperm whale’s jaw. He announces his desire to pursue
and kill Moby Dick, the legendary great white whale who took his
leg, because he sees this whale as the embodiment of evil. Ahab
nails a gold doubloon to the mast and declares that it will be the
prize for the first man to sight the whale. As the Pequod sails
toward the southern tip of Africa, whales are sighted and unsuccessfully
hunted. During the hunt, a group of men, none of whom anyone on
the ship’s crew has seen before on the voyage, emerges from the
hold. The men’s leader is an exotic-looking man named Fedallah.
These men constitute Ahab’s private harpoon crew, smuggled aboard
in defiance of Bildad and Peleg. Ahab hopes that their skills and
Fedallah’s prophetic abilities will help him in his hunt for Moby
Dick."

World War I who was injured in trench warfare and now suffers from
shell shock. Septimus and his Italian wife, Lucrezia, pass time
in Regent’s Park. They are waiting for Septimus’s appointment with
Sir William Bradshaw, a celebrated psychiatrist. Before the war,
Septimus was a budding young poet and lover of Shakespeare; when
the war broke out, he enlisted immediately for romantic patriotic
reasons. He became numb to the horrors of war and its aftermath:
when his friend Evans died, he felt little sadness. Now Septimus
sees nothing of worth in the England he fought for, and he has lost
the desire to preserve either his society or himself. Suicidal,
he believes his lack of feeling is a crime. Clearly Septimus’s experiences
in the war have permanently scarred him, and he has serious mental
problems. However, Sir William does not listen to what Septimus

separate Septimus from Lucrezia and send him to a mental institution

lunch, Richard returns home to Clarissa with a large bunch of roses.
He intends to tell her that he loves her but finds that he cannot,
because it has been so long since he last said it. Clarissa considers
the void that exists between people, even between husband and wife.
Even though she values the privacy she is able to maintain in her
marriage, considering it vital to the success of the relationship,
at the same time she finds slightly disturbing the fact that Richard
doesn’t know everything about her. Clarissa sees off Elizabeth and
her history teacher, Miss Kilman, who are going shopping. The two
older women despise one another passionately, each believing the
other to be an oppressive force over Elizabeth. Meanwhile, Septimus
and Lucrezia are in their apartment, enjoying a moment of happiness together

their youth. Though the social order is undoubtedly changing, Elizabeth
and the members of her generation will probably repeat the errors
of Clarissa’s generation. Sir William Bradshaw arrives late, and
his wife explains that one of his patients, the young veteran (Septimus),
has committed suicide. Clarissa retreats to the privacy of a small
room to consider Septimus’s death. She understands that he was overwhelmed
by life and that men like Sir William make life intolerable. She
identifies with Septimus, admiring him for having taken the plunge
and for not compromising his soul. She feels, with her comfortable

Tim must decide what to do with the eight cows he and his mother have received as payment for their tavern goods. He wants to sell them for a profit. Sam returns to Redding with his troops and advises Tim to kill the cows and hide the meat so as to prevent cattle theft, but Tim is hesitant. Eventually, two men try to steal the cows from the barn, and when Sam runs out to stop them, the men grab him and frame him as the cattle thief. Since cattle stealing has been a problem in the armed forces, General Putnam is determined to make an example out of somebody. Both Tim and his mother talk to the rebel officers, pleading Sam's innocence, but the general will not change his mind. Tim tries to break into the encampment and save his brother, but nothing comes of it. On February 16, 1779, Tim looks on as Sam is publicly shot."

MythologyEdith Hamilton,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mythology/summary.html,"According to classical mythology, the universe began
in a manner that—remarkably—resembles the modern scientific theory
of the big bang. There was originally only chaos and darkness. Out
of the swirling energy Earth and Heaven arose and gave birth to
many children. Though most of these children were monsters, they
eventually gave rise to the Titans, a race of gods in human form.
One of the Titans overthrew his sky-father, only to see his own
son Zeus overthrow him later."
MythologyEdith Hamilton,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mythology/summary.html,"Mythology resembles
one large SparkNote in itself, offering a detailed overview of the
myths of ancient Greece and Rome and a brief overview of Norse mythology.
Since a tradition as immense as classical mythology cannot be presented
in any linear fashion, Mythology frequently contains
references to characters or stories that are not explained until
later. Nonetheless, it is perfectly acceptable to skip around in
the book to alleviate this confusion whenever it arises."
MythologyEdith Hamilton,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mythology/summary.html,"The stories about these heroes, which account for the
founding of certain cities or the legitimacy of certain dynastic
bloodlines, were meant to explain phenomena that the Greeks observed
in the world around them. The Greeks also told many other tales,
often of a nonheroic nature, to explain the qualities of flowers,
lightning, landscapes, and so on. Indeed, as Hamilton writes, these
myths can be seen as “early science.” Much of classical myth, however,
is far more complex than these simple explanatory tales. The works
of the Greek playwrights, written around 500 b.c.,
portray a rich, complex social and ethical fabric and are sensitive
to the most profound issues of the human condition. The protagonists
of these plays, caught in webs of circumstances beyond their control,
have to nonetheless face their situations and make moral decisions
of direst consequence to themselves and others. Many scholars consider
these Greek tragedies to be as sophisticated in their psychology
and writing as anything penned since."
MythologyEdith Hamilton,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mythology/summary.html,"Hamilton begins by providing her rationale for the study
of mythology and her understanding of its nature. She then introduces the
major gods and describes the creation of the universe. Twelve primary
gods live together on Mount Olympus: Zeus, the chief of these Olympians,
is joined by his wife (and sister) Hera; his daughter Athena; his
sons Hermes and Ares; the brother-and-sister pair Apollo and Artemis
(also Zeus’s children); Zeus’s brothers Poseidon and Hades; his
sister Hestia; and Hephaestus and his wife Aphrodite (both sometimes
considered to be Zeus’s children as well). The names of these gods
are Greek in origin, but the Romans renamed most of the gods when
they adopted them. Except in cases when a story is told exclusively
by a Roman author, Hamilton employs the original Greek names in
her retelling. Besides these twelve are two other important gods—Zeus’s
sister Demeter and his son Dionysus—who live on earth rather than
on Mount Olympus."
MythologyEdith Hamilton,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mythology/summary.html,"Zeus and his siblings defeated all the Titans in a fierce
battle and installed themselves as the lords of the universe. They
created humankind and promptly began manipulating their new creatures. Zeus,
an incurable philanderer, frequently descended to Earth, often in
some magical form, to have his way with beautiful human women. The
offspring of these liaisons grew to be the first heroes among humankind,
and, with the gods’ aid, won many victories against vicious monsters
and completed monumental tasks. Many of these half-divine heroes,
along with their few all-mortal peers, went on to found the dynasties
of Greece. The most notable of these heroes are Theseus, Hercules,
Cadmus, Achilles, and Aeneas."
MythologyEdith Hamilton,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mythology/summary.html,"Hamilton reserves a final section for the traditions
of the Norsemen. Unlike the Greek and Roman stories, which have
been retold in many versions that still exist today, the Norse tales
have barely survived. Christian obsession with the destruction of
pagan material swept clean Scandinavia, Germany, and other Norse
areas. Only in Iceland did written versions of Norse tales survive.
These Icelandic texts, which date from about a.d. 1300 but reflect a much older oral tradition, depict a bleak, dismal,
and ultimately doomed universe, headed for a day of battle between
good and evil in which even the gods will be destroyed. Though Hamilton’s
treatment of Norse myth is brief, it does offer a striking contrast
to the comparatively sunny world of Mediterranean myth."
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/narrative/summary.html,"Douglass’s life on this plantation is not as hard as that
of most of the other slaves. Being a child, he serves in the household
instead of in the fields. At the age of seven, he is given to Captain
Anthony’s son‑in‑law’s brother, Hugh Auld, who lives in Baltimore.
In Baltimore, Douglass enjoys a relatively freer life. In general,
city slave-owners are more conscious of appearing cruel or neglectful
toward their slaves in front of their non‑slaveowning neighbors."
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/narrative/summary.html,"In Baltimore’s trade industry, Douglass runs up against
strained race relations. White workers have been working alongside
free black workers, but the whites have begun to fear that the increasing numbers
of free blacks will take their jobs. Though only an apprentice and
still a slave, Douglass encounters violent tactics of intimidation
from his white coworkers and is forced to switch shipyards. In his
new apprenticeship, Douglass quickly learns the trade of caulking
and soon earns the highest wages possible, always turning them over
to Hugh Auld."
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/narrative/summary.html,"Frederick Douglass was born into
slavery sometime in 1817 or 1818.
Like many slaves, he is unsure of his exact date of birth. Douglass
is separated from his mother, Harriet Bailey, soon after he is born.
His father is most likely their white master, Captain Anthony. Captain
Anthony is the clerk of a rich man named Colonel Lloyd. Lloyd owns
hundreds of slaves, who call his large, central plantation the “Great
House Farm.” Life on any of Lloyd’s plantations, like that on many
Southern plantations, is brutal. Slaves are overworked and exhausted, receive
little food, few articles of clothing, and no beds. Those who break
rules—and even those who do not—are beaten or whipped, and sometimes
even shot by the plantation overseers, the cruelest of which are
Mr. Severe and Mr. Austin Gore."
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/narrative/summary.html,"His year with Covey over, Douglass is next rented to William Freeland
for two years. Though Freeland is a milder, fairer man, Douglass’s
will to escape is nonetheless renewed. At Freeland’s, Douglass begins
edu-cating his fellow slaves in a Sabbath school at the homes of
free blacks. Despite the threat of punishment and violence they
face, many slaves from neighboring farms come to Douglass and work
diligently to learn. At Freeland’s, Douglass also forms a plan of
escape with three fellow slaves with whom he is close. Someone betrays
their plan to Freeland, however, and Douglass and the others are
taken to jail. Thomas Auld then sends Douglass back to Baltimore
with Hugh Auld, to learn the trade of ship caulking."
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/narrative/summary.html,"Sophia Auld, Hugh’s wife, has never had slaves before,
and therefore she is surprisingly kind to Douglass at first. She
even begins to teach Douglass to read, until her husband orders
her to stop, saying that education makes slaves unmanageable. Eventually,
Sophia succumbs to the mentality of slaveowning and loses her natural
kindliness. Though Sophia and Hugh Auld become crueler toward him, Douglass
still likes Baltimore and is able to teach himself to read with
the help of local boys. As he learns to read and write, Douglass becomes
conscious of the evils of slavery and of the existence of the abolitionist,
or antisla-very, movement. He resolves to escape to the North eventually."
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/narrative/summary.html,"After the deaths of Captain Anthony and his remaining
heirs, Douglass is taken back to serve Thomas Auld, Captain Anthony’s son‑in‑law.
Auld is a mean man made harsher by his false religious piety. Auld
considers Douglass unmanageable, so Auld rents him for one year
to Edward Covey, a man known for “breaking” slaves. Covey manages,
in the first six months, to work and whip all the spirit out of
Douglass. Douglass becomes a brutish man, no longer interested in
reading or freedom, capable only of resting from his injuries and
exhaustion. The turning point comes when Douglass resolves to fight
back against Covey. The two men have a two‑hour fight, after which
Covey never touches Douglass again."
Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/narrative/summary.html,"Eventually, Douglass receives permission from Hugh Auld
to hire out his extra time. He saves money bit by bit and eventually makes
his escape to New York. Douglass refrains from describing the details
of his escape in order to protect the safety of future slaves who
may attempt the journey. In New York, Douglass fears recapture and
changes his name from Bailey to Douglass. Soon after, he marries
Anna Murray, a free woman he met while in Baltimore. They move north
to Massachusetts, where Douglass becomes deeply engaged with the
abolitionist movement as both a writer and an orator."

Mary to meet her communist boyfriend, Jan. Eager to prove their
progressive ideals and racial tolerance, Mary and Jan force Bigger
to take them to a restaurant in the South Side. Despite Bigger’s
embarrassment, they order drinks, and as the evening passes, all
three of them get drunk. Bigger then drives around the city while
Mary and Jan make out in the back seat. Afterward, Mary is too drunk
to make it to her bedroom on her own, so Bigger helps her up the

white woman, Bigger begins to kiss Mary."
Native SonRichard Wright,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nativeson/summary.html,"Bigger Thomas, a poor,
uneducated, twenty-year-old black man in 1930s
Chicago, wakes up one morning in his family’s cramped apartment
on the South Side of the city. He sees a huge rat scamper across
the room, which he corners and kills with a skillet. Having grown
up under the climate of harsh racial prejudice in 1930s
America, Bigger is burdened with a powerful conviction that he has
no control over his life and that he cannot aspire to anything other
than menial, low-wage labor. His mother pesters him to take a job
with a rich white man named Mr. Dalton, but Bigger instead chooses
to meet up with his friends to plan the robbery of a white man’s
store."
Native SonRichard Wright,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nativeson/summary.html,"Mary’s murder gives Bigger a sense of power and identity
he has never known. Bigger’s girlfriend, Bessie, makes an offhand
comment that inspires him to try to collect ransom money from the
Daltons. They know only that Mary has vanished, not that she is
dead. Bigger writes a ransom letter, playing upon the Daltons’ hatred
of communists by signing his name “Red.” He then bullies Bessie
to take part in the ransom scheme. However, Mary’s bones are found in
the furnace, and Bigger flees with Bessie to an empty building. Bigger
rapes Bessie and, frightened that she will give him away, bludgeons
her to death with a brick after she falls asleep."

Mrs. Dalton, enters the bedroom. Though Mrs. Dalton cannot see him, her
ghostlike presence terrifies him. Bigger worries that Mary, in her drunken
condition, will reveal his presence. He covers her face with a pillow
and accidentally smothers her to death. Unaware that Mary has been
killed, Mrs. Dalton prays over her daughter and returns to bed.
Bigger tries to conceal his crime by burning Mary’s body in the Daltons’
furnace. He decides to try to use the Daltons’ prejudice against
communists to frame Jan for Mary’s disappearance. Bigger believes
that the Daltons will assume Jan is dangerous and that he may have
kidnapped their daughter for political purposes. Additionally, Bigger
takes advantage of the Daltons’ racial prejudices to avoid suspicion,
continuing to play the role of a timid, ignorant black servant who
would be unable to commit such an act."
Native SonRichard Wright,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nativeson/summary.html,"Anger, fear, and frustration define Bigger’s daily existence,
as he is forced to hide behind a façade of toughness or risk succumbing
to despair. While Bigger and his gang have robbed many black-owned businesses,
they have never attempted to rob a white man. Bigger sees
whites not as individuals, but as a natural, oppressive force—a great
looming “whiteness” pressing down upon him. Bigger’s fear of confronting
this force overwhelms him, but rather than admit his fear, he violently
attacks a member of his gang to sabotage the robbery. Left with
no other options, Bigger takes a job as a chauffeur for the Daltons."
Native SonRichard Wright,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nativeson/summary.html,"Bigger eludes the massive manhunt for as long as he can,
but he is eventually captured after a dramatic shoot-out. The press
and the public determine his guilt and his punishment before his
trial even begins. The furious populace assumes that he raped Mary
before killing her and burned her body to hide the evidence of the
rape. Moreover, the white authorities and the white mob use Bigger’s crime
as an excuse to terrorize the entire South Side ."

Wright forces us to enter into Bigger’s mind and to understand the
devastating effects of the social conditions in which he was raised.
Bigger was not born a violent criminal. He is a “native son”: a
product of American culture and the violence and racism that suffuse
it."
Native SonRichard Wright,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nativeson/summary.html,"Max tries to save Bigger from the death penalty, arguing
that while his client is responsible for his crime, it is vital
to recognize that he is a product of his environment. Part of the
blame for Bigger’s crimes belongs to the fearful, hopeless existence

as he owns a controlling share of the company that manages the apartment
building where Bigger’s family lives. Mr. Dalton and other wealthy
real estate barons are effectively robbing the poor, black tenants
on Chicago’s South Side—they refuse to allow blacks to rent apartments
in predominantly white neighborhoods, thus leading to overpopulation
and artificially high rents in the predominantly black South Side.
Mr. Dalton sees himself as a benevolent philanthropist, however,
as he donates money to black schools and offers jobs to “poor, timid

NauseaJean-Paul Sartre,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nausea/summary.html,"For the past ten years, Roquentin has been researching the Marquis de Rollebon, a French aristocrat who lived during the French Revolution. Rollebon was originally from Bouville so Roquentin moved there to complete his research and write a book about him. But his feelings of Nausea soon extend to his research. Whenever he looks in a mirror, he is not sure if he sees his own face or Rollebon's. He soon loses interest in his work, realizing that he can never understand Rollebon as if he were still alive. Roquentin feels constrained by the past, choosing instead to live in the present."

He had hoped that they would get back together, but is disappointed to find that they do not communicate very well. He vainly attempts to explain his feelings of Nausea to Anny, but she does not understand. They part, knowing that they will never see each other again. Back in Bouville, Roquentin resolves to free himself from the past by embracing his existence in the present. He tries to explain his views to the Self-Taught Man, a lonely cafe acquaintance, but he cannot persuade him that human love is just an essence, and that there is no purpose to existence, only ""nothingness."" Despite his despair and abandoning his research, Roquentin chooses to move to Paris and write a novel."
NauseaJean-Paul Sartre,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nausea/summary.html,"Roquentin begins to understand that his feelings of Nausea have something to do with the question of existence. He realizes that he had been using Rollebon and the past in general to justify his own existence. Roquentin defiantly asserts his own existence, claiming that everyone else he sees is afraid to acknowledge that they exist. Focusing on the existence of objects and people, Roquentin discovers that ""existence precedes essence."" Looking at the root of a chestnut tree, he realizes that his perception of the root's essence, or its physical characteristics, in fact hides the truth of the object's existence. The comforting facade of tastes, colors, smells, weight, and appearance are thus the creation of the observer. Looking through the essence of objects, Roquentin is confronted with the bare existence of things, and thus the source of his Nausea."

Nevertheless, a few days later, he is so overcome with what he calls the Nausea, that he begins to furiously list every insignificant fact, detail, feeling, and impression occurring both inside himself and the outside world.

the family’s poverty, Tambu’s parents were able to raise the fees to send Nhamo to
school. There was not enough money to send Tambu as well, so she decided to grow and
sell vegetables and raise the money herself. When she discovered that her brother
was stealing food from her garden patch, she attempted to beat him up while the two
were attending Sunday school. Tambu’s teacher, Mr. Matimba, took her to Umtali, a
local urban center, to sell green ears of corn. A white woman, Doris, and her
husband pitied Tambu and gave Mr. Matimba ten pounds sterling to pay for her
education."

in her aunt and uncle’s house on the mission school grounds. Maiguru warmly welcomes
Tambu into her new home. She serves Tambu tea and pastries and gives her an entirely
new wardrobe, all in preparation for her first day of school. The coldness and
emotional distance that once existed between Nyasha and Tambu quickly disappear.
Tambu becomes absorbed in her studies. She soon learns the rhythms of
the household, witnessing Nyasha and Babamukuru’s frequent fights. She

England. Chido and Nyasha, Tambu’s cousins, had lost the ability to speak their
native tongue, Shona. Maiguru did not want them participating in the dancing and
other festive activities. At the end of the meal, Tambu was ordered to bring a bowl
of water to each member of the extended family so they could wash their hands.
Babamukuru’s three siblings praised his success. He proposed educating a member of
each family, focusing especially on the neediest branch, Tambu’s clan. They chose

Lucia, Tambu’s mother’s sister, and Takesure, a relative of Tambu’s father, still
living at the homestead. To make matters worse, Lucia is pregnant with Takesure’s
child. A family meeting is held to decide what course of action should be taken.
Ultimately the couple is allowed to remain, as Babamukuru shifts his focus to
another moral issue that rankles him: his own brother’s unsanctified domestic

Never Let Me GoKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/never-let-me-go/summary.html,"In Norfolk, Chrissie and Rodney ask about a rumored exception allowing Hailsham couples in love to defer their donations. Ruth pretends to know something about deferrals, which surprises Kathy and Tommy. The students eventually find the open-plan office. Rodney points to a woman in the window, and they all agree that she could be Ruth’s legitimate possible. They follow her to an art gallery, where they realize that the woman does not actually resemble Ruth. In her disappointment, Ruth says that the students are modeled only on “trash.” Ruth goes off with Chrissie and Rodney. Meanwhile, Tommy and Kathy find a copy of Kathy’s lost tape in a secondhand store. Tommy tells Kathy that he has begun drawing pictures of imaginary animals. He thinks Madame uses the students’ artwork to determine if couples applying for deferrals are truly in love. After Norfolk, Ruth stops talking about her dream future. Tommy shows his drawings to Kathy, who finds them puzzling but captivating. Meanwhile, Kathy’s friendship with Ruth grows increasingly tense. Ruth reveals that she knows Kathy likes Tommy, but says that Tommy will never return Kathy’s feelings. Shortly afterwards, Kathy submits her application for carer training and departs."
Never Let Me GoKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/never-let-me-go/summary.html,"Never Let Me Go takes place in a dystopian version of late 1990s England, where the lives of ordinary citizens are prolonged through a state-sanctioned program of human cloning. The clones, referred to as students, grow up in special institutions away from the outside world. As young adults, they begin to donate their vital organs. All “donors” receive care from designated “carers,” clones who have not yet begun the donation process. The clones continue to donate organs until they “complete,” which is a euphemism for death after the donation of three or four organs. However, this premise is not immediately apparent to the reader. At the start of the novel, narrator Kathy H. merely introduces herself as a thirty-one-year-old carer. She has been a carer for nearly twelve years, but will leave her role in a few months. Kathy explains that she wants to revisit her memories of Tommy and Ruth, two friends who grew up with her at the Hailsham school. Kathy does not explain the donation program, or mention that Hailsham students are clones."
Never Let Me GoKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/never-let-me-go/summary.html,"Ruth completes after her second donation. Tommy gives his third donation, and Kathy becomes his carer. They spend their days reading and talking at his recovery center. Eventually, they also begin to have sex. Hoping to pursue a deferral, they go to visit Madame at the address Ruth provided. Madame invites them inside and listens to their request, after which Miss Emily appears from the next room. Miss Emily says that deferrals do not exist. She explains that Hailsham was part of a progressive movement committed to raising clones more humanely. Madame used to exhibit the students’ artwork to show the outside world that clones had souls. Although the movement once had many supporters, changing public opinion eventually forced Hailsham to close. On the drive back to his recovery center, Tommy asks Kathy to pull over. He walks into the woods and begins screaming. Kathy goes to Tommy and holds him. Soon after, Tommy gives his fourth donation and completes. Kathy drives to a field in Norfolk, where she allows herself to imagine Tommy on the horizon. Then she drives away."
Never Let Me GoKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/never-let-me-go/summary.html,"In Part Two, Kathy moves with Ruth and Tommy to a transitional housing facility known as the Cottages. They adjust to their new lives, becoming acquainted with the “veteran” students living there already. Ruth often ignores Tommy and Kathy in her efforts to blend in with the veterans, who are not from Hailsham. Kathy notices that the veterans regard the Hailsham students with awe. One couple, Chrissie and Rodney, are especially interested in Hailsham. They convince Ruth to go with them to Norfolk, where Rodney claims to have seen Ruth’s “possible” in an open-plan office (a “possible” is a human that resembles a specific clone and from whom that clone's DNA may have been copied). Kathy is skeptical of Rodney’s story, especially since it features Ruth’s “dream future” of working in an open-plan office. In the end, Kathy, Tommy, Ruth, Rodney, and Chrissie all drive to Norfolk."
Never Let Me GoKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/never-let-me-go/summary.html,"Although the students learn vaguely about the donation program, their guardians shield them from a full understanding of their future. Miss Lucy disagrees with this indirect approach, and often exhibits strange behavior in front of the students as a result, in one instance telling them explicitly about their futures. After Miss Lucy speaks with Tommy about his artwork, he and Kathy theorize that creativity may be connected to donations. They speculate about Madame, a woman who visits Hailsham to collect the best student artwork. Madame is rumored to keep this art in a personal gallery. Kathy later encounters Madame in the girls’ dormitory, while Kathy dances to the song “Never Let Me Go.” The song is Kathy’s favorite track on Songs After Dark, a Judy Bridgewater album that is one of her most prized possessions. When the song ends, Kathy sees Madame crying in the doorway. Shortly afterwards, Kathy loses her tape. Tommy’s temper returns during their last summer at Hailsham. Kathy thinks he is upset about his recent breakup with Ruth, whom he has dated for six months. But Tommy is upset about Miss Lucy, who recently told him that she was wrong to dismiss the importance of creativity. Miss Lucy departs Hailsham abruptly, and Tommy mends his relationship with Ruth."
Never Let Me GoKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/never-let-me-go/summary.html,"Although Kathy’s narration is often nonlinear, the novel’s three parts roughly align with three stages in her life. In Part One, Kathy remembers her childhood at Hailsham. She describes her friendship with Ruth, whose temperamental personality contrasts with her own quiet demeanor. At Hailsham, Ruth often annoys Kathy by pretending to have special knowledge and privileges. Kathy also describes Tommy, a student known for throwing violent temper tantrums. Tommy is initially an outcast among his peers because he lacks artistic ability, which the Hailsham staff (part teacher, part parent figures known as “guardians”), and its students value highly. Kathy sympathizes with Tommy, and tries to calm him down during one of his tantrums. Tommy later learns to control his temper after a guardian named Miss Lucy assures him that it is not necessary for him to be creative."
Never Let Me GoKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/never-let-me-go/summary.html,"Part Three focuses on Kathy’s time as carer. While Kathy is good at her job, the work is both difficult and lonely. She unexpectedly runs into a Hailsham friend named Laura, who is also a carer. They talk about Ruth, who had a bad first donation. They also talk about Hailsham, which has closed. Kathy becomes Ruth’s carer, but their relationship is strained and guarded. One day, Ruth expresses a desire to visit a beached fishing boat near Tommy’s recovery center. They pick up Tommy on the way to the boat, which they find bleached and crumbling in a marsh. The marsh reminds both Tommy and Ruth of Hailsham. They also discuss Chrissie, who completed on her second donation. On the return trip, Ruth apologizes for keeping Tommy and Kathy apart. She encourages them to pursue a deferral, revealing that she has discovered Madame’s home address. In the weeks that follow, Kathy and Ruth reminisce peacefully about Hailsham and the Cottages. Ruth also encourages Kathy to become Tommy’s carer."
Night,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/night/summary.html,"After months in the camp, Eliezer undergoes an operation
for a foot injury. While he is in the infirmary, however, the Nazis
decide to evacuate the camp because the Russians are advancing and
are on the verge of liberating Buna. In the middle of a snowstorm,
the prisoners begin a death march: they are forced to run for more
than fifty miles to the Gleiwitz concentration camp. Many die of
exposure to the harsh weather and exhaustion. At Gleiwitz, the prisoners
are herded into cattle cars once again. They begin another deadly
journey: one hundred Jews board the car, but only twelve remain
alive when the train reaches the concentration camp Buchenwald. Throughout
the ordeal, Eliezer and his father help each other to survive by
means of mutual support and concern. In Buchenwald, however, Eliezer’s
father dies of dysentery and physical abuse. Eliezer survives, an
empty shell of a man until April 11, 1945,
the day that the American army liberates the camp."
Night,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/night/summary.html,"Upon his arrival in Birkenau, Eliezer and his father are
separated from his mother and sisters, whom they never see again.
In the first of many “selections” that Eliezer describes in the
memoir, the Jews are evaluated to determine whether they should
be killed immediately or put to work. Eliezer and his father seem
to pass the evaluation, but before they are brought to the prisoners’
barracks, they stumble upon the open-pit furnaces where the Nazis
are burning babies by the truckload."
Night,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/night/summary.html,"Night is narrated by Eliezer, a
Jewish teenager who, when the memoir begins, lives in his hometown
of Sighet, in Hungarian Transylvania. Eliezer studies the Torah
(the first five books of the Old Testament) and the Cabbala (a doctrine
of Jewish mysticism). His instruction is cut short, however, when
his teacher, Moshe the Beadle, is deported. In a few months, Moshe
returns, telling a horrifying tale: the Gestapo (the German secret
police force) took charge of his train, led everyone into the woods,
and systematically butchered them. Nobody believes Moshe, who is
taken for a lunatic."
Night,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/night/summary.html,"The Jewish arrivals are stripped, shaved, disinfected,
and treated with almost unimaginable cruelty. Eventually, their
captors march them from Birkenau to the main camp, Auschwitz. They
eventually arrive in Buna, a work camp, where Eliezer is put to
work in an electrical-fittings factory. Under slave-labor conditions,
severely malnourished and decimated by the frequent “selections,”
the Jews take solace in caring for each other, in religion, and
in Zionism, a movement favoring the establishment of a Jewish state
in Palestine, considered the holy land. In the camp, the Jews are
subject to beatings and repeated humiliations. A vicious foreman
forces Eliezer to give him his gold tooth, which is pried out of
his mouth with a rusty spoon."
Night,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/night/summary.html,"The prisoners are forced to watch the hanging of fellow
prisoners in the camp courtyard. On one occasion, the Gestapo even
hang a small child who had been associated with some rebels within
Buna. Because of the horrific conditions in the camps and the ever-present danger
of death, many of the prisoners themselves begin to slide into cruelty,
concerned only with personal survival. Sons begin to abandon and
abuse their fathers. Eliezer himself begins to lose his humanity
and his faith, both in God and in the people around him."

Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"Shostak narrates from a position in the present, reflecting back on her
experiences in Africa. (Nisa, too, tells her stories in the past tense.) In the
introduction, Shostak says that her motivation for coming to Africa was primarily to
learn about the internal lives of the !Kung people, whose more easily discernable
qualities (such as diet, life cycle, and demographics) had already been studied by
other anthropologists for years. She and her husband join in the ongoing research,
Shostak feeling particularly inclined to study the women of the !Kung tribe. She
learns the language and interviews a number of women, but it is Nisa who captures
her attention most. Nisa answers Shostak’s questions with colorful language and
vivid stories. After a few interviews, Nisa tells Shostak that her mother wanted to
kill Nisa’s younger brother right after he was born so that Nisa could continue to
nurse. Shostak is taken aback and starts to doubt Nisa’s truthfulness, but she
eventually comes to trust her."
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"Chapter 10 begins with Shostak’s observations of the !Kung’s changing
environment and way of life, which have been increasingly influenced by neighboring
cattle-herding groups, the Tswana and the Herero. Nisa then discusses her marriage
to a Tswana man named Besa, as well as the complications of her several love affairs
with other men. In Chapter 11, Nisa travels from the Tswana village back to her
parents’ village after learning her father has died. Soon after, her mother dies,
and Nisa herself falls ill but is cured by her elder brother, Dau, who is a healer.
Nisa begins working in the house of a European woman who lives near their village.
She also becomes pregnant with Besa’s child but miscarries. In Chapter 12, Nisa
continues to tell Shostak about her many lovers and also recalls being a child and
seeing her mother with her lover and telling her father about her mother’s affair.
She also explains to Shostak that the !Kung women talk freely with each other about
sex, and she asks Shostak if that isn’t the same with all women."
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"In Chapter 1, Nisa describes her early memories of accompanying her pregnant
mother as she gives birth to Nisa’s baby brother, Kumsa, and threatens to kill him,
though she does not actually commit infanticide. In Chapter 2, Nisa recalls growing
up with her brother, playing with him, experiencing sibling hatred, and protecting
him from harm. She remembers her mother’s pregnancy with her fourth child, Kxamshe,
who dies young. In Chapter 3, Nisa describes the life of a hunter-gatherer, hunting
prey, celebrating the arrival of meat in the village, gathering roots and bulbs,
experiencing thirst in times of drought, and gorging on caterpillars in times of
rain."
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"Nisa takes on several lovers, as is common in !Kung society, and when she
becomes pregnant, as recounted in Chapter 8, her husband gets very jealous. He
accuses her of infidelity and questions the baby’s paternity. Nisa gives birth to a
baby girl, Chuko, who dies in infancy. In Chapter 9, Nisa describes her four
subsequent pregnancies. She has a baby girl, Nai, then miscarries, then has another
girl who dies young, and then has a son, Kxau."
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"In Chapter 4, Nisa remembers what it was like to engage in sex play with other
children in the village for the first time, and she recalls some of the boys’ sexual
aggression toward her and other girls. She notes that parents and children sleep in
the same hut, so that the children become aware of what their parents are doing when
they move under the blankets. In Chapter 5, Nisa tells Shostak about her first two
marriages, one to a man named Bo, the other to a man named Tsaa. Both marriages end
quickly, as is typical of early “trial” marriages in !Kung society. Nisa also
describes her feelings of love for a man named Kantla, who is already married and
who invites her to be a co-wife, an offer that Nisa refuses."
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"Chapter 13 deals with the !Kung belief in the spirit world and, in particular,
with the role spirits are thought to play in illness and healing. Nisa describes her
father’s and older brother’s healing abilities. She also tells Shostak about how her
mother taught her to go into a trance and about her own once-potent capabilities as
a healer. In Chapter 14, Nisa painfully recounts the deaths of her two last
surviving children. Nai dies after being shoved by her husband, and Kxau succumbs to
serious illness after eating honey that the spirits have designated for the honey
badger. In Chapter 15, Nisa expresses hurt over the fact that her husband no longer
wants to sleep with her very often, and she says she feels she has grown ugly. She
mentions that she has been through menopause and asks Shostak for medicine to bring
back her menses."

interviews Shostak has with Nisa during her first Dobe visit, plus an epilogue. Each
chapter opens with an overview by Shostak on the topic, theme, stage of life, or
experience Nisa is about to narrate. In these introductions, Shostak draws from
interviews with other !Kung men and women, work done by other anthropologists, her
own observations and analyses, and historical and geographical contexts."
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"Nisa opens with an introduction by Shostak, detailing her own
preparations and expectations for her first trip to the Dobe region of Africa, in
northwest Botswana and at the edge of the Kalahari Desert. Shostak describes Nisa’s
people, the Zhun/twasi (“real people”), bushmen who are hunter-gatherers and members
of a racial group known as Khoisan. The Khoisan are considered by biologists to be
distinct from black Africans, with fair skin, high cheekbones, and an average height
of only about five feet."
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"The epilogue briefly describes Shostak’s return to Dobe in 1975, when she, her
husband, and a graduate student conduct a research study on women’s menstrual
cycles. She also meets with Nisa and interviews her again. She finds Nisa to be calm
and in good spirits, and Nisa agrees when Shostak asks if it would be all right to
publish the interviews as a book."
Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung WomanMarjorie Shostak,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/nisa/summary.html,"In Chapter 6, Nisa enters her first long marriage, to a man named Tashay. She
and Tashay grow to love each other. Early in their marriage, Nisa experiences her
first menstruation, and the women of the village enclose her in a hut and perform
the ritual ceremonies that accompany that momentous event in a !Kung woman’s life.
Chapter 7 concerns the infrequent though not uncommon practice of adopting a
co-wife. Nisa tells of her own brief experience with a co-wife Tashay brings to the
hut. Before long, Nisa drives the co-wife away and the marriage resumes as normal."

Obi decides to ignore this and go against what most of his fellow countrymen believe to be a major transgression of custom, and he decides he will marry her anyway. Still, his economic hardship worsens, given that he has to send money home and that he is in debt. Obi then receives a letter from his father telling him that he must go home. When he arrives at home he sees that his mother is very ill. And, his parents tell him he must not marry Clara because she is an osu.

However, Obi awakes from this unrest with a new sense of calm. He feels like a new man, and it is at this point that he takes his first bribe, not without a certain degree of guilt."

Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"The Underground Man has great contempt for nineteenth--century
utilitarianism, a school of thought that attempted to use mathematical
formulas and logical proofs to align man’s desires with his best
interests. The Underground Man complains that man’s primary desire
is to exercise his free will, whether or not it is in his best interests.
In the face of utilitarianism, man will do nasty and unproductive
things simply to prove that his free will is unpredictable and therefore
completely free. This assertion partially explains the Underground
Man’s insistence that he takes pleasure in his own toothaches or
liver pains: such pleasure in pain is a way of spiting the comfortable
predictability of life in modern society, which accepts without
question the value of going to the doctor. The Underground Man is
not proud of all this useless behavior, however. He has enormous
contempt for himself as a human being. He is aware that he is so
overcome by inertia that he cannot even become wicked enough to
be a scoundrel, or insignificant enough to be an insect, or lazy
enough to be a true lazybones."
Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"The anonymous narrator of Notes
from Underground is a bitter, misanthropic man living alone
in St. Petersburg, Russia, in the 1860s.
He is a veteran of the Russian civil service who has recently been
able to retire because he has inherited some money. The novel consists
of the “notes” that the man writes, a confused and often contradictory
set of memoirs or confessions describing and explaining his alienation from
modern society."
Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"Notes from Underground is divided into
two sections. The first, “Underground,” is shorter and set in the 1860s,
when the Underground Man is forty years old. This section serves
as an introduction to the character of the Underground Man, explaining
his theories about his antagonistic position toward society."
Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"The first words we hear from the Underground Man tell
us that he is “a sick man . . . a wicked man . . . an unattractive
man” whose self-loathing and spite has crippled and corrupted him.
He is a well-read and highly intelligent man, and he believes that
this fact accounts for his misery. The Underground Man explains
that, in modern society, all conscious and educated men should be
as miserable as he is. He has become disillusioned with all philosophy.
He has appreciation for the sublime, Romantic idea of “the beautiful and
lofty,” but he is aware of its absurdity in the context of his narrow,
mundane existence."
Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"The Underground Man’s alienation manifests itself in all
kinds of relationships. When walking in the park, he obsesses about
whether to yield the right of way to a soldier whom he does not
even know. Then, in a confused attempt at social interaction, the
Underground Man deliberately follows some school acquaintances to
a dinner where he is not wanted, alternately insulting them openly
and craving their attention and friendship. Later that same evening,
the Underground Man attempts to rescue an attractive young prostitute named
Liza by delivering impassioned, sentimental speeches about the terrible
fate that awaits her if she continues to sell her body."
Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"“Apropos of the Wet Snow” describes interactions between
the Underground Man and various people who inhabit his world: soldiers,
former schoolmates, and prostitutes. The Underground Man is so alienated
from these people that he is completely incapable of normal interaction
with them. He treats them with a mixture of disgust and fear that
results in his own effacement or humiliation—which in turn result
in remorse and self-loathing."
Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"Here the Underground Man decides to end his notes. In
a footnote at the end of the novel, Dostoevsky reveals that the
Underground Man fails to make even this simple decision to stop
writing, as Dostoevsky says that the manuscript of the notes goes
on for many pages beyond the point at which he has chosen to cut
it off."
Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"When Liza comes to visit the Underground Man in his shoddy apartment
several days later, he reacts with shame and anger when he realizes
she has reason to pity or look down upon him. The Underground Man
continues to insult Liza throughout the visit. Hurt and confused,
she leaves him alone in his apartment."
Notes from UndergroundFyodor Dostoevsky,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/underground/summary.html,"The second fragment of Notes from Underground, entitled “Apropos
of the Wet Snow,” describes specific events in the Underground Man’s
life in the 1840s, when he was twenty-four
years old. In a sense, this section serves as a practical illustration
of the more abstract ideas the Underground Man sets forth in the
first section. This second section reveals the narrator’s progression
from his youthful perspective, influenced by Romanticism and ideals
of “the beautiful and lofty,” to his mature perspective in 1860,
which is purely cynical about beauty, loftiness, and literariness
in general."

for more gruel at the end of a meal, Mr. Bumble, the parish beadle,
offers five pounds to anyone who will take the boy away from the
workhouse. Oliver narrowly escapes being apprenticed to a brutish
chimney sweep and is eventually apprenticed to a local undertaker,

do with his parcel. Shukhov helps him guard it from the other prisoners. Tsezar
rewards Shukhov with a couple of biscuits and a bit of sausage.
Before sleeping, Shukhov thanks God for getting him through another
day. Alyoshka hears Shukhov’s prayer, and urges Shukhov to pray
properly. He also encourages Shukhov to pursue the goods of the
spirit and not, as Tsezar does, those of the flesh. Shukhov reflects
on Alyoshka’s sentiment. Suddenly, for no reason, he hands Alyoshka
one of his biscuits. Shukhov meditates that his day has been almost

One Day in the Life of Ivan DenisovichAlexander Solzhenitsyn,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/denisovich/summary.html,"A wake-up call sounds in a Stalinist
labor camp in 1951, on a bitterly cold winter
morning. Ivan Denisovich Shukhov, a prisoner in Camp HQ, is usually
up on time, but this morning he suffers a fever and aches, and yearns for
a little more time in bed. Thinking that a kindly guard is on duty,
he rests past the wake-up call a while. Unfortunately, a different
guard is making the rounds, and he punishes Shukhov for oversleeping
with three days in the solitary confinement cell, which the characters
call “the hole.” Led off, Shukhov soon realizes that the sentence
is just a threat, and that he will only have to wash the floors
of the officers’ headquarters. Shukhov removes his shoes and efficiently
completes the job, proceeding quickly to the mess hall, where he
worries he has missed breakfast. He meets the sniveling Fetyukov,
a colleague who has saved Shukhov’s gruel for him. After breakfast,
Shukhov heads to sick bay to get his fever and aches examined. The
medical orderly, Kolya, tells him he should have been ill the previous
night, since the clinic is closed in the morning. Shukhov’s fever
is not high enough to get him off work."

He is full after eating two bowls of gruel. The gang returns to
the work site. On the way, Shukhov spots a bit of scrap metal in
the snow, which he takes and hides in the hopes of making a knife
out of it later. The prisoners stoke the stove. While preparing
to work again, the gang hears Tyurin’s tale of being imprisoned
for having a rich peasant father. The men begin to mortar the wall.
One of the deputy foremen, Pavlo, agrees to be on the mortar team,
though, as an officer, he is not required to mortar. Pavlo’s friendliness
earns him the men’s respect. The bricklaying begins. Shukhov works
feverishly and makes no errors. A camp manager stops by to chide
Tyurin for the tar paper illegally hung in the work site windows.
He threatens to punish Tyurin, but Tyurin waves him off. Alyoshka
works selflessly. Time passes quickly, and the men hear the meal
signal. Shukhov continues working, even after his colleague Kildigs
has stopped. He is late to lunch now, but he wants to hide his precious trowel,
a tool that is hard to get, so that another man will not take it. He
is nearly unable to join his gang, but catches up when the gang
is delayed by preparations for another body count. The men discover that
a man from Moldavia is missing from another gang. The man, who has
fallen asleep at the site, is finally found. The other men are furious
at him for delaying their meal."

suddenly panics, remembering the bit of steel he has hidden in his
mitten. He prays to God to be kept out of the hole. By a stroke
of good luck, the guard does not discover the bit of steel. Shukhov
returns to the camp. On the suspicion that a fellow inmate, Tsezar,
has received a rich parcel of food, he offers to wait in line in the
parcel room for Tsezar. Shukhov waits until Tsezar comes. There is
indeed a package. Shukhov makes his way to the mess hall for supper,
where the gangs are being admitted by twos instead of singly, creating
a chaos inside. He manages to find his comrades, grab an empty tray,
and bring their rations to the table. For his outstanding labor
at the Power Station, Shukhov has been awarded 400 grams of
bread. He eats in bliss, eyeing his extra rations to make sure no one
grabs them. He takes Tsezar’s ration to the hut, where Tsezar, in exception
to the camp rules, is allowed to eat. Tsezar has displayed the contents
of his parcel to everyone, and he allows Shukhov to keep Tsezar’s
supper ration."

with respect for his foreman, Tyurin, a big tough man with a decent
soul. Though they are forbidden to do so, the men try to keep the
wind out of the windows by covering them with tar paper. The teenage
prisoner Gopchik fetches wire for piping, and asks Shukhov to show
him how to make a spoon. They all rest a while. It is too soon before

Buynovsky, is wearing a flannel vest. He is sentenced to ten days
in the hole for this infraction. Shukhov is happy not to have any
forbidden things on him. He has neither food nor letters to his
family, which he does not write anymore. He reflects on his wife’s
recent letter urging him to take up carpet-dyeing when he gets out
of prison. But Shukhov is not interested in this opportunity, despite

cleaning chores. McMurphy stages a protest by sitting in front of
the blank television instead of doing his work, and one by one the
other patients join him. Nurse Ratched loses control and screams

In retaliation, she has him lobotomized, and he returns to the ward
as a vegetable. However, Ratched has lost her tyrannical power over the
ward. The patients transfer to other wards or check themselves out
of the hospital. Bromden suffocates McMurphy in his bed, enabling
him to die with some dignity rather than live as a symbol of Ratched’s

One Hundred Years of SolitudeGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/solitude/summary.html,"More than a century goes by over the course of the book,
and so most of the events that García Márquez describes are the
major turning points in the lives of the Buendías: births, deaths,
marriages, love affairs. Some of the Buendía men are wild and sexually
rapacious, frequenting brothels and taking lovers. Others are quiet
and solitary, preferring to shut themselves up in their rooms to
make tiny golden fish or to pore over ancient manuscripts. The
women, too, range from the outrageously outgoing, like Meme, who
once brings home seventy-two friends from boarding school, to the prim
and proper Fernanda del Carpio, who wears a special nightgown with
a hole at the crotch when she consummates her marriage with her
husband."
One Hundred Years of SolitudeGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/solitude/summary.html,"One Hundred Years of Solitude is
the history of the isolated town of Macondo and of the family who founds
it, the Buendías. For years, the town has no contact with the outside
world, except for gypsies who occasionally visit, peddling technologies
like ice and telescopes. The patriarch of the family, José Arcadio Buendía, is impulsive and inquisitive. He remains a leader who is
also deeply solitary, alienating himself from other men in his obsessive
investigations into mysterious matters. These character traits are
inherited by his descendents throughout the novel. His older child,
José Arcadio, inherits his vast physical strength and his impetuousness.
His younger child, Aureliano, inherits his intense, enigmatic focus. Gradually,
the village loses its innocent, solitary state when it establishes
contact with other towns in the region. Civil wars begin, bringing
violence and death to peaceful Macondo, which, previously, had experienced
neither, and Aureliano becomes the leader of the Liberal rebels,
achieving fame as Colonel Aureliano Buendía. Macondo changes from
an idyllic, magical, and sheltered place to a town irrevocably connected
to the outside world through the notoriety of Colonel Buendía. Macondo’s
governments change several times during and after the war. At one
point, Arcadio, the cruelest of the Buendías, rules dictatorially
and is eventually shot by a firing squad. Later, a mayor is appointed,
and his reign is peaceful until another civil uprising has him killed.
After his death, the civil war ends with the signing of a peace
treaty."
One Hundred Years of SolitudeGabriel García Márquez,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/solitude/summary.html,"A sense of the family’s destiny for greatness remains
alive in its tenacious matriarch, Ursula Iguarán, and she works
devotedly to keep the family together despite its differences. But
for the Buendía family, as for the entire village of Macondo, the
centrifugal forces of modernity are devastating. Imperialist capitalism
reaches Macondo as a banana plantation moves in and exploits the
land and the workers, and the Americans who own the plantation settle
in their own fenced-in section of town. Eventually, angry at the
inhumane way in which they are treated, the banana workers go on
strike. Thousands of them are massacred by the army, which sides
with the plantation owners. When the bodies have been dumped into
the sea, five years of ceaseless rain begin, creating a flood that
sends Macondo into its final decline. As the city, beaten down by
years of violence and false progress, begins to slip away, the Buendía
family, too, begins its process of final erasure, overcome by nostalgia
for bygone days. The book ends almost as it began: the village is
once again solitary, isolated. The few remaining Buendía family
members turn in upon themselves incestuously, alienated from the
outside world and doomed to a solitary ending. In the last scene
of the book, the last surviving Buendía translates a set of ancient
prophecies and finds that all has been predicted: that the village
and its inhabitants have merely been living out a preordained cycle,
incorporating great beauty and great, tragic sadness."

The following Sunday at church the pastor publicly confronts them about their fallen state. Melanie repents immediately, but Jeanette argues and flees. She takes refuge at the house of Miss Jewsbury, who is herself a lesbian, and that evening Miss Jewsbury and Jeanette sleep together. The following day the elders of the church attempt to exorcise the demons from Jeanette by laying hands on her for fourteen hours. When she still will not repent, her mother locks her in the parlor for thirty- six hours with no food. After this hungry spell, she pretends to repent, but maintains her impression that she has not done anything wrong by loving both Melanie and God."
Oranges are Not the Only FruitJeanette Winterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oranges/summary.html,"Melanie disappears and Jeanette becomes deeply involved in the church again. Her role in the church has grown and she now preaches her own sermons and teaches Sunday school. Soon Jeanette begins a new affair with Katy, a recent convert. When they are caught one weekend, Jeanette takes all the blame saying that she had been with Melanie. The church then decides that Jeanette has been given too much responsibility so that she now almost thinks that she is a man. They insist that she give up teaching and preaching. Instead, Jeanette quits the church. Jeanette's mother forces her to leave their home since her evilness will bring illness to them all."
Oranges are Not the Only FruitJeanette Winterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oranges/summary.html,"With no home, friends, or money, Jeanette takes up various jobs. She works in a funeral parlor, as an ice cream truck driver, and eventually at a mental hospital. On occasion, she runs into her mother or members of her congregation who treat Jeanette coldly and say she is possessed by demons. Eventually she moves to the city. After an unspecified time, Jeanette does return home one winter to see her mother. Her mother still faithfully believes, but her Society for the Lost has been shaken by corruption. Jeanette's mother does not discuss Jeanette's lifestyle with her, but her behavior indicates that she has softened in her beliefs. Jeanette's mother still listens to the missionary reports on the radio system with her usual fervor."
Oranges are Not the Only FruitJeanette Winterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oranges/summary.html,"As she ages, Jeanette realizes that she sometimes disagrees with the teachings of her congregation. Jeanette particularly disagrees with one sermon about the nature of perfection. Although Jeanette begins to see some difference in her ideas and those of the church, she still is closely aligned with her mother who is a motivating member of their Society for the Lost."
Ordinary PeopleJudith Guest,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ordinarypeople/summary.html,"During the winter, Conrad goes to see a swim meet on a whim, and afterwards he gets into a fist fight with an old friend who has begun to treat him cruelly. In some ways, it is unclear whether Conrad is really getting better. His father grows increasingly concerned about him. That spring, he goes to stay with his grandparents while his parents go on vacation to Houston. There, he spends lots of time with Jeannine. One night, however, he reads in the newspaper that his friend Karen has committed suicide. He is suddenly thrown into shock, and he spends the whole night in a dream-like trance thinking about his time with Karen, his own suicide attempt, and the death of his brother. He goes out walking at 2 am to think some more, and he is stopped by a police officer and told to return home. He falls back into a dream at home and then wakes up at dawn. He immediately calls Berger and requests to meet with him. In Berger's office, Conrad has a breakdown and admits that he blames himself for the death of Buck. Berger tells him to stop blaming himself and to stop trying to fill Buck's shoes; Conrad needs to allow himself to feel more even when he feels bad, and he needs to be himself for a change. After this breakdown and release of emotion, Conrad begins to heal substantially, enjoying a great relationship with Jeannine. At the end of the novel, he has moved to Evanston with his family, and in the Epilogue we see him rebuilding his old friendship with Lazenby."
Ordinary PeopleJudith Guest,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ordinarypeople/summary.html,"The story of Conrad is told opposite the story of his father, Calvin, who spends most of his time in the novel worrying about Conrad. Calvin is a tax attorney who runs a small firm with his partner, Ray Hanley. Most of the chapters devoted to Calvin depict him by himself, thinking about the past and his son and wife. It is clear from the beginning that Calvin and Beth have serious communication problems. Essentially, Calvin wants to talk through the past with his family; he believes that talking is the way to heal. Beth, however, abhors Calvin's philosophy: she only wants to move on and leave the past behind. She also constantly criticizes her husband for pampering Conrad. She thinks Conrad ought to be left to grow up on his own without parents breathing down his neck all the time. Indeed, Beth thinks that she managed to heal her own hurts on her own, and she does not understand why everyone else can't do the same. Calvin and Beth attend parties together and spend lots of time with their own friends, and we see them in numerous situations. As the novel progresses, however, the communication rift between Beth and Calvin only widens. They fight more and more about how to treat Conrad. They also fight about vacations. Beth feels that the family must get away from Illinois for Christmas, but Calvin makes them stay in Lake Forest in hopes that they can talk through their problems as a family. In the spring, they take a golfing trip to Houston together; however, things blow up when Beth again rails on Calvin for his obsession with Conrad. When they return to Illinois, they hardly speak to one another until Beth announces to Calvin that she is leaving for Europe. While they do not talk about divorce, their differences seem irrevocable by the end of the novel. After Beth leaves, however, Conrad and Calvin really come together for the first time in the novel, saying that they love each other and showing an interest in developing a better relationship. Calvin and Conrad move to Evanston."
Ordinary PeopleJudith Guest,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ordinarypeople/summary.html,"Ordinary People is set in Lake Forest, Illinois, during the 1970s. The action focuses on the Jarrett family--Calvin and Beth and their son Conrad. Before the action of the book begins, there was a second Jarrett son--Buck--who was killed in a boating accident over a year before the novel begins. After the death of Buck, Conrad became deeply troubled, blaming himself. He tried to commit suicide by slashing his wrists; his attempt failed when Calvin found him, before he died, in the bathtub. After the attempt, Conrad was hospitalized. He went through therapy and befriended Karen, a girl his age who had also tried to kill herself."
Ordinary PeopleJudith Guest,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ordinarypeople/summary.html,"The action of the book begins a month after Conrad is released from the hospital. While he is physically cured, he is by no means emotionally cured, and at the request of his father, he begins to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Berger. He tells Berger that he doesn't think highly of psychiatry, but he wants Berger to help him gain more control over others so that he can make his father stop worrying about him. Conrad goes back to school, where he has experienced a severe academic downturn ever since Buck's death. He is a junior, and he is a member of the swimming team. However, he feels he is becoming alienated from even some of his best friends, such as Joe Lazenby, and ends up becoming more and more isolated. He decides to quit the swimming team, although he does not tell his parents about the decision until a month later. He spends his time instead in the library after school. He even goes out for a Coke with his old friend Karen at one point, and he sees that she is doing much better. As the year progresses, he becomes interested in a girl at school named Jeannine Pratt, who is new to Lake Forest. They go out a couple of times before they start to date seriously towards the end of the year. Meanwhile, Conrad continues to see Berger, although it is unclear whether he is making much progress. The novel focuses on his family life, and we see that Conrad is becoming increasingly alienated from his mother, who is not interested in pampering him or dwelling on the past. His relationship with his father is somewhat strained as well."

Because Orlando speaks fluent French, he is the only one who can converse with her. They grow very close, become lovers, and plan to run away together. One day, Orlando sees her on the knee of a Russian sailor and he grows very angry. She assures him that nothing at all is going on.

when God sends the Son to end the war and deliver Satan and his
rebel angels to Hell. Raphael tells Adam about Satan’s evil motives
to corrupt them, and warns Adam to watch out for Satan. Adam asks
Raphael to tell him the story of creation. Raphael tells Adam that
God sent the Son into Chaos to create the universe. He created the
earth and stars and other planets. Curious, Adam asks Raphael about
the movement of the stars and planets. Eve retires, allowing Raphael and Adam to speak alone. Raphael promptly warns Adam
about his seemingly unquenchable search for knowledge. Raphael tells
Adam that he will learn all he needs to know, and that any other
knowledge is not meant for humans to comprehend. Adam tells Raphael
about his first memories, of waking up and wondering who he was,
what he was, and where he was. Adam says that God spoke to him and
told him many things, including his order not to eat from the Tree
of Knowledge. After the story, Adam confesses to Raphael his intense
physical attraction to Eve. Raphael reminds Adam that he must love
Eve more purely and spiritually. With this final bit of advice,
Raphael leaves Earth and returns to Heaven."
Paradise LostJohn Milton,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/paradiselost/summary.html,"In Heaven, God orders the angels together for a council
of their own. He tells them of Satan’s intentions, and the Son volunteers himself
to make the sacrifice for humankind. Meanwhile, Satan travels through
Night and Chaos and finds Earth. He disguises himself as a cherub
to get past the Archangel Uriel, who stands guard at the sun. He
tells Uriel that he wishes to see and praise God’s glorious creation,
and Uriel assents. Satan then lands on Earth and takes a moment
to reflect. Seeing the splendor of Paradise brings him pain rather
than pleasure. He reaffirms his decision to make evil his good, and
continue to commit crimes against God. Satan leaps over Paradise’s
wall, takes the form of a cormorant (a large bird), and perches himself
atop the Tree of Life. Looking down at Satan from his post, Uriel
notices the volatile emotions reflected in the face of this so-called
cherub and warns the other angels that an impostor is in their midst.
The other angels agree to search the Garden for intruders."
Paradise LostJohn Milton,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/paradiselost/summary.html,"God hears their prayers, and sends Michael down to Earth. Michael
arrives on Earth, and tells them that they must leave Paradise.
But before they leave, Michael puts Eve to sleep and takes Adam
up onto the highest hill, where he shows him a vision of humankind’s
future. Adam sees the sins of his children, and his children’s children,
and his first vision of death. Horrified, he asks Michael if there
is any alternative to death. Generations to follow continue to sin
by lust, greed, envy, and pride. They kill each other selfishly
and live only for pleasure. Then Michael shows him the vision of
Enoch, who is saved by God as his warring peers attempt to kill
him. Adam also sees the story of Noah and his family, whose virtue
allows them to be chosen to survive the flood that kills all other humans.
Adam feels remorse for death and happiness for humankind’s redemption.
Next is the vision of Nimrod and the Tower of Babel. This story
explains the perversion of pure language into the many languages
that are spoken on Earth today. Adam sees the triumph of Moses and
the Israelites, and then glimpses the Son’s sacrifice to save humankind.
After this vision, it is time for Adam and Eve to leave Paradise.
Eve awakes and tells Adam that she had a very interesting and educating
dream. Led by Michael, Adam and Eve slowly and woefully leave Paradise
hand in hand into a new world."
Paradise LostJohn Milton,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/paradiselost/summary.html,"Meanwhile, Adam and Eve tend the Garden, carefully obeying God’s
supreme order not to eat from the Tree of Knowledge. After a long
day of work, they return to their bower and rest. There, Satan takes
the form of a toad and whispers into Eve’s ear. Gabriel, the angel
set to guard Paradise, finds Satan there and orders him to leave.
Satan prepares to battle Gabriel, but God makes a sign appear in
the sky—the golden scales of justice—and Satan scurries away. Eve
awakes and tells Adam about a dream she had, in which an angel tempted
her to eat from the forbidden tree. Worried about his creation,
God sends Raphael down to Earth to teach Adam and Eve of the dangers
they face with Satan."
Paradise LostJohn Milton,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/paradiselost/summary.html,"Milton’s speaker begins Paradise
Lost by stating that his subject will be Adam and Eve’s
disobedience and fall from grace. He invokes a heavenly muse and
asks for help in relating his ambitious story and God’s plan for
humankind. The action begins with Satan and his fellow rebel angels
who are found chained to a lake of fire in Hell. They quickly free
themselves and fly to land, where they discover minerals and construct
Pandemonium, which will be their meeting place. Inside Pandemonium,
the rebel angels, who are now devils, debate whether they should
begin another war with God. Beezelbub suggests that they attempt
to corrupt God’s beloved new creation, humankind. Satan agrees,
and volunteers to go himself. As he prepares to leave Hell, he is
met at the gates by his children, Sin and Death, who follow him
and build a bridge between Hell and Earth."
Paradise LostJohn Milton,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/paradiselost/summary.html,"God immediately knows of their disobedience. He tells
the angels in Heaven that Adam and Eve must be punished, but with
a display of both justice and mercy. He sends the Son to give out
the punishments. The Son first punishes the serpent whose body Satan
took, and condemns it never to walk upright again. Then the Son
tells Adam and Eve that they must now suffer pain and death. Eve
and all women must suffer the pain of childbirth and must submit
to their husbands, and Adam and all men must hunt and grow their
own food on a depleted Earth. Meanwhile, Satan returns to Hell where he
is greeted with cheers. He speaks to the devils in Pandemonium, and
everyone believes that he has beaten God. Sin and Death travel the
bridge they built on their way to Earth. Shortly thereafter, the devils
unwillingly transform into snakes and try to reach fruit from imaginary
trees that shrivel and turn to dust as they reach them."
Paradise LostJohn Milton,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/paradiselost/summary.html,"Eight days after his banishment, Satan returns to Paradise.
After closely studying the animals of Paradise, he chooses to take
the form of the serpent. Meanwhile, Eve suggests to Adam that they
work separately for awhile, so they can get more work done. Adam
is hesitant but then assents. Satan searches for Eve and is delighted
to find her alone. In the form of a serpent, he talks to Eve and
compliments her on her beauty and godliness. She is amazed to find
an animal that can speak. She asks how he learned to speak, and
he tells her that it was by eating from the Tree of Knowledge. He
tells Eve that God actually wants her and Adam to eat from the tree,
and that his order is merely a test of their courage. She is hesitant
at first but then reaches for a fruit from the Tree of Knowledge
and eats. She becomes distraught and searches for Adam. Adam has
been busy making a wreath of flowers for Eve. When Eve finds Adam,
he drops the wreath and is horrified to find that Eve has eaten
from the forbidden tree. Knowing that she has fallen, he decides
that he would rather be fallen with her than remain pure and lose
her. So he eats from the fruit as well. Adam looks at Eve in a new
way, and together they turn to lust."
Paradise LostJohn Milton,http://www.sparknotes.com/poetry/paradiselost/summary.html,"God tells the angels to transform the Earth. After the
fall, humankind must suffer hot and cold seasons instead of the
consistent temperatures before the fall. On Earth, Adam and Eve
fear their approaching doom. They blame each other for their disobedience and
become increasingly angry at one another. In a fit of rage, Adam wonders
why God ever created Eve. Eve begs Adam not to abandon her. She
tells him that they can survive by loving each other. She accepts
the blame because she has disobeyed both God and Adam. She ponders
suicide. Adam, moved by her speech, forbids her from taking her
own life. He remembers their punishment and believes that they can
enact revenge on Satan by remaining obedient to God. Together they
pray to God and repent."

The Cherokee tribe has suffered an inordinate amount at the hands of white Americans throughout history; now, white America is still taking children from the Nation. Also, Annawake explains that this pursuance is also for Turtle's benefit. Native American children who grow up outside the nation without a sense of their heritage, usually suffer greatly."

Pride and Prejudice,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html,"At the beginning of winter, the Bingleys and Darcy leave
Netherfield and return to London, much to Jane’s dismay. A further
shock arrives with the news that Mr. Collins has become engaged
to Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth’s best friend and the poor daughter
of a local knight. Charlotte explains to Elizabeth that she is getting
older and needs the match for financial reasons. Charlotte and Mr.
Collins get married and Elizabeth promises to visit them at their
new home. As winter progresses, Jane visits the city to see friends
(hoping also that she might see Mr. Bingley). However, Miss Bingley
visits her and behaves rudely, while Mr. Bingley fails to visit
her at all. The marriage prospects for the Bennet girls appear bleak."
Pride and Prejudice,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html,"The news that a wealthy young
gentleman named Charles Bingley has rented the manor
of Netherfield Park causes a great stir in the nearby village of
Longbourn, especially in the Bennet household. The Bennets have
five unmarried daughters—from oldest to youngest, Jane, Elizabeth,
Mary, Kitty, and Lydia—and Mrs. Bennet is desperate to see them
all married. After Mr. Bennet pays a social visit to Mr. Bingley,
the Bennets attend a ball at which Mr. Bingley is present. He is taken
with Jane and spends much of the evening dancing with her. His close
friend, Mr. Darcy, is less pleased with the evening and haughtily
refuses to dance with Elizabeth, which makes everyone view him as
arrogant and obnoxious."
Pride and Prejudice,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html,"Now married, Wickham and Lydia return to Longbourn briefly, where
Mr. Bennet treats them coldly. They then depart for Wickham’s new
assignment in the North of England. Shortly thereafter, Bingley
returns to Netherfield and resumes his courtship of Jane. Darcy
goes to stay with him and pays visits to the Bennets but makes no
mention of his desire to marry Elizabeth. Bingley, on the other hand,
presses his suit and proposes to Jane, to the delight of everyone
but Bingley’s haughty sister. While the family celebrates, Lady Catherine
de Bourgh pays a visit to Longbourn. She corners Elizabeth and says
that she has heard that Darcy, her nephew, is planning to marry
her. Since she considers a Bennet an unsuitable match for a Darcy,
Lady Catherine demands that Elizabeth promise to refuse him. Elizabeth
spiritedly refuses, saying she is not engaged to Darcy, but she
will not promise anything against her own happiness. A little later,
Elizabeth and Darcy go out walking together and he tells her that
his feelings have not altered since the spring. She tenderly accepts
his proposal, and both Jane and Elizabeth are married."
Pride and Prejudice,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html,"Shortly thereafter, however, a letter arrives from home,
telling Elizabeth that Lydia has eloped with Wickham and that the
couple is nowhere to be found, which suggests that they may be living together
out of wedlock. Fearful of the disgrace such a situation would bring
on her entire family, Elizabeth hastens home. Mr. Gardiner and Mr.
Bennet go off to search for Lydia, but Mr. Bennet eventually returns
home empty-handed. Just when all hope seems lost, a letter comes
from Mr. Gardiner saying that the couple has been found and that
Wickham has agreed to marry Lydia in exchange for an annual income.
The Bennets are convinced that Mr. Gardiner has paid off Wickham,
but Elizabeth learns that the source of the money, and of her family’s
salvation, was none other than Darcy."
Pride and Prejudice,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html,"This letter causes Elizabeth to reevaluate
her feelings about Darcy. She returns home and acts coldly toward
Wickham. The militia is leaving town, which makes the younger, rather
man-crazy Bennet girls distraught. Lydia manages to obtain permission
from her father to spend the summer with an old colonel in Brighton,
where Wickham’s regiment will be stationed. With the arrival of
June, Elizabeth goes on another journey, this time with the Gardiners,
who are relatives of the Bennets. The trip takes her to the North
and eventually to the neighborhood of Pemberley, Darcy’s estate.
She visits Pemberley, after making sure that Darcy is away, and
delights in the building and grounds, while hearing from Darcy’s
servants that he is a wonderful, generous master. Suddenly, Darcy
arrives and behaves cordially toward her. Making no mention of his
proposal, he entertains the Gardiners and invites Elizabeth to meet
his sister."
Pride and Prejudice,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html,"That spring, Elizabeth visits Charlotte, who now lives
near the home of Mr. Collins’s patron, Lady Catherine de Bourgh,
who is also Darcy’s aunt. Darcy calls on Lady Catherine and encounters Elizabeth,
whose presence leads him to make a number of visits to the Collins’s
home, where she is staying. One day, he makes a shocking proposal
of marriage, which Elizabeth quickly refuses. She tells Darcy that
she considers him arrogant and unpleasant, then scolds him for steering
Bingley away from Jane and disinheriting Wickham. Darcy leaves her
but shortly thereafter delivers a letter to her. In this letter,
he admits that he urged Bingley to distance himself from Jane, but
claims he did so only because he thought their romance was not serious.
As for Wickham, he informs Elizabeth that the young officer is a
liar and that the real cause of their disagreement was Wickham’s
attempt to elope with his young sister, Georgiana Darcy."
Pride and Prejudice,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html,"At social functions over subsequent weeks, however, Mr.
Darcy finds himself increasingly attracted to Elizabeth’s charm
and intelligence. Jane’s friendship with Mr. Bingley also continues
to burgeon, and Jane pays a visit to the Bingley mansion. On her
journey to the house she is caught in a downpour and catches ill,
forcing her to stay at Netherfield for several days. In order to
tend to Jane, Elizabeth hikes through muddy fields and arrives with
a spattered dress, much to the disdain of the snobbish Miss Bingley,
Charles Bingley’s sister. Miss Bingley’s spite only increases when
she notices that Darcy, whom she is pursuing, pays quite a bit of
attention to Elizabeth."
Pride and Prejudice,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pride/summary.html,"When Elizabeth and Jane return home, they find Mr. Collins
visiting their household. Mr. Collins is a young clergyman who stands to
inherit Mr. Bennet’s property, which has been “entailed,” meaning
that it can only be passed down to male heirs. Mr. Collins is a pompous
fool, though he is quite enthralled by the Bennet girls. Shortly
after his arrival, he makes a proposal of marriage to Elizabeth.
She turns him down, wounding his pride. Meanwhile, the Bennet girls
have become friendly with militia officers stationed in a nearby
town. Among them is Wickham, a handsome young soldier who is friendly
toward Elizabeth and tells her how Darcy cruelly cheated him out
of an inheritance."
Prometheus BoundAeschylus,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/prometheus/summary.html,"Io enters wearing cow horns. Screaming that a gadfly is biting her and the ghost of Argos pursues her, she calls on Zeus and asks why he tortures her like this. In response to her questions, Prometheus reveals who he is and why he is being punished. Io asks him to tell her about her future wanderings, but first the Chorus asks to know of her past suffering. Io tells how Zeus became infatuated with her and forced her father to drive her out of his house. Io was turned into a cow and guarded by Argos, but he was killed and returned as a ghost along with a gadfly that drove her around the world. Prometheus tells her of her future wanderings through Europe, Asia, and Africa, where she must constantly avoid dangerous peoples and monsters."
Prometheus BoundAeschylus,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/prometheus/summary.html,"Oceanus flies in on a winged beast and says that Prometheus should stop provoking Zeus while he himself goes to the god to have Prometheus freed.

Oceanus argues that words are needed for healing, but Prometheus counters that the medicine must be applied at the proper time. Convinced by Prometheus's categorical refusal of his help, Oceanus departs."
Prometheus BoundAeschylus,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/prometheus/summary.html,"Prometheus reveals that Zeus, who makes Io suffer, will one day choose a mate whose son will depose his father. Only Prometheus can help Zeus prevent this. He reveals also that one day Io's descendant will free him. He then concludes the story of Io's journey, telling how at the end of her suffering Zeus will cure and impregnate her with a gentle touch of his hand. Prometheus talks about Io's descendants, who will become kings of the city Argos. Io runs off again tortured by the gadfly, and the Oceanids chant about the dangers of marrying above one's own rank, expressing the hope that Zeus never takes an interest in them."
Prometheus BoundAeschylus,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/prometheus/summary.html,"Kratus and Bia, two servants of Zeus, carry in Prometheus and hold him against a rocky mountain in the Caucasus. Hephaestus, whose job is to chain Prometheus to the rock, follows them. Kratus states that this is a punishment for giving fire to human beings, and Prometheus must learn to like Zeus's rule. Hephaestus expresses his pity for Prometheus, lamenting the fact that he must bind his friend to the rock. Kratus urges him on, insisting that pity for Zeus's enemies is both useless and dangerous. Hephaestus finishes his task and leaves with Kratus and Bia."
Prometheus BoundAeschylus,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/prometheus/summary.html,"The Chorus sings that the entire old world mourns for Prometheus and his brothers who also suffer at the hands of Zeus, especially Atlas who must hold the world. Prometheus summarizes everything he has done for humanity. He taught human beings agriculture, language, mathematics, harnessing of animals, and sailing. He also taught medicine, divination, and mining. He insists that all human arts come from him. Prometheus almost reveals his prophecy to the Chorus, but stops himself, saying only that it will free him because Zeus is a slave to necessity like all others. The Oceanids affirm their piety to Zeus, chide Prometheus for helping mortals who cannot help him back, and remember his happy wedding to their sister."
Prometheus BoundAeschylus,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/prometheus/summary.html,"Prometheus calls on nature to witness the suffering of a god at the hands of other gods, specifically the new ruler Zeus. He mentions that he has the gift of prophecy and knows all that will happen. He must live with his suffering because no one can fight fate. Prometheus hears the sound of wings and discovers that it is the Chorus of Oceanids, daughters of Oceanus, on winged chariots. The Oceanids express their sympathy for Prometheus's suffering, explaining that the new ruler of Olympus follows only his own laws. Prometheus prophecies that one days Zeus will be in danger and will be forced to befriend him to avoid it."
Prometheus BoundAeschylus,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/prometheus/summary.html,"Angered by Io's suffering, Prometheus shouts out that Zeus's own son will topple him. Zeus's messenger Hermes enters and orders Prometheus to reveal the identity of this son's mother. Prometheus mocks Hermes and says that he will tell nothing. Hermes accuses Prometheus of being overly obstinate, disobedient, and mad. Prometheus deflects each accusation with direct insults or sarcasm. Hermes warns that if Prometheus does not yield, a storm will send him to Tartarus. Then he will emerge only to have an eagle eat his liver every day, and this will not end until a god agrees to die for him. The Chorus advises Prometheus to yield, but he shows no fear of his destiny. Hermes orders the Oceanids away, but they reply that to betray a friend is the worst crime of all and vow to stay with Prometheus. As the earth begins to shake and thunder gathers around him, Prometheus calls on the elements to witness his suffering."
Prometheus BoundAeschylus,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/prometheus/summary.html,"Asked what crime he has committed to deserve this punishment, Prometheus recounts the war between Zeus and the Titans. He had tried to help the Titans, but they refused his guile and decided to use force. Prometheus then offered his guile to Zeus, helping him win. Now Zeus punishes him because like all tyrants he distrusts his friends. Zeus had planned to destroy humanity but Prometheus stood in his way. Questioned further, Prometheus recounts that he gave humanity blind hope and also the gift of fire. The Chorus responds to this last admission, saying that he has sinned, but Prometheus replies that he did so willingly and will not now renounce his action. He asks the Chorus to come down to earth so he can tell them the whole story."

This knife is stolen by ""Tom"" and used to kill Judge Driscoll. Luigi gets into an argument with ""Tom,"" who has him arrested. The judge is mortified that ""Tom"" has compromised the family honor by doing that, and he instead challenges Luigi to a duel. No one is killed, but ""Tom,"" to save his own reputation, tells his uncle that Luigi is a confessed assassin and therefore not an honorable man to duel. The twins, initially popular in the town, lose their reputation through the judge's claims against them, and lose in an election for city offices in which Pudd'nhead Wilson is elected mayor.

On his tail is Eliza's father, now unhappily rich from the trust of a deceased millionaire who took to heart Higgins' recommendation that Doolittle was England's ""most original moralist."" Mrs. Higgins, who has been hiding Eliza upstairs all along, chides the two of them for playing with the girl's affections. When she enters, Eliza thanks Pickering for always treating her like a lady, but threatens Higgins that she will go work with his rival phonetician, Nepommuck. The outraged Higgins cannot help but start to admire her. As Eliza leaves for her father's wedding, Higgins shouts out a few errands for her to run, assuming that she will return to him at Wimpole Street.

PygmalionGeorge Bernard Shaw,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/pygmalion/summary.html,"For a number of months, Higgins trains Eliza to speak properly. Two trials for Eliza follow. The first occurs at Higgins' mother's home, where Eliza is introduced to the Eynsford Hills, a trio of mother, daughter, and son. The son Freddy is very attracted to her, and further taken with what he thinks is her affected ""small talk"" when she slips into cockney. Mrs. Higgins worries that the experiment will lead to problems once it is ended, but Higgins and Pickering are too absorbed in their game to take heed. A second trial, which takes place some months later at an ambassador's party (and which is not actually staged), is a resounding success. The wager is definitely won, but Higgins and Pickering are now bored with the project, which causes Eliza to be hurt. She throws Higgins' slippers at him in a rage because she does not know what is to become of her, thereby bewildering him. He suggests she marry somebody.

Professor Higgins is a scientist of phonetics, and Colonel Pickering is a linguist of Indian dialects. The first bets the other that he can, with his knowledge of phonetics, convince high London society that, in a matter of months, he will be able to transform the cockney speaking Covent Garden flower girl, Eliza Doolittle, into a woman as poised and well-spoken as a duchess. The next morning, the girl appears at his laboratory on Wimpole Street to ask for speech lessons, offering to pay a shilling, so that she may speak properly enough to work in a flower shop. Higgins makes merciless fun of her, but is seduced by the idea of working his magic on her. Pickering goads him on by agreeing to cover the costs of the experiment if Higgins can pass Eliza off as a duchess at an ambassador's garden party. The challenge is taken, and Higgins starts by having his housekeeper bathe Eliza and give her new clothes.

Meanwhile, however, the noose of justice tightens around Maxim: first, it is found that holes have been drilled in the bottom of Rebecca's boat; luckily the coroner delivers a report of suicide, rather than murder. But soon Rebecca's cousin Favell, certain that Rebecca did not kill herself, accuses Maxim of the crime. The local magistrate, Colonel Julyan, investigates, and finds that on the day of her death, Rebecca went up to London to see a Doctor Baker. Favell, Maxim, and the heroine accompany Julyan to London; the heroine is certain that Baker will reveal that Rebecca was pregnant, thus revealing Maxim's vengeful motive for murder. But instead, it turns out that Rebecca was dying of cancer, and that furthermore she was infertile; she had lied to Maxim about her pregnancy. Her terminal illness now supplies a motive for Rebecca's supposed suicide, and Maxim is saved. He and the heroine drive all night back to Manderley, stopping only once, when Maxim calls home and learns that Mrs. Danvers has disappeared. As they crest the ridge near the mansion, they look down and find it in flames."

Upon seeing the heroine, Maxim is horrified, and the heroine becomes convinced that he will never love her, that he is still devoted to Rebecca. The following day, Mrs. Danvers almost convinces her to kill herself, and she only breaks away from the old woman's spell when rockets go off over the cove, signaling that a ship has run aground. When divers swim near the grounded ship, they find the wreckage of Rebecca's sailboat, with Rebecca's dead body in the hold. This discovery prompts Maxim to tell the heroine the truth: Rebecca was a malevolent, wicked woman, who lived a secret life and carried on multiple affairs, including one with her cousin, Jack Favell. On the night of her death, Maxim had demanded a divorce, and she had refused, and told him that she was pregnant with Favell's child. Furious, he seized a gun and shot her, and then sailed out to the harbor in Rebecca's boat and sank it, with the body stowed safely inside."

But a dark cloud hangs over their marriage: Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, drowned in a cove near Manderley the previous year, and her ghost haunts the newlyweds' home. Rebecca's devoted housekeeper, the sinister Mrs. Danvers, is still in charge of Manderley, and she frightens and intimidates her new mistress. Despite the encouragement of the house overseer, Frank Crawley, and Maxim's sister, Beatrice, the heroine struggles in her new life at Manderley.

Jean upbraids Berenger for his drinking habits and his aimlessness. Soon, a rhinoceros runs through the square (off-stage), shocking all the townspeople with the exception of the indifferent Berenger. Jean lectures Berenger about will-power while a rational Logician explains the concept of a syllogism to an old man. Berenger concedes that he has a crush on Daisy, a typist at his office, but worries that she favors Dudard, an up-and-coming co-worker. Jean recommends will-power and cultural self- improvement to garner Daisy's affections, and to improve his life in general. Another rhino rushes by and tramples a cat. The townspeople debate whether or not it was the same rhino and what breed it was. Berenger and Jean get in a fight over the physical specifics of the rhino, and Jean storms off after calling Berenger a drunkard. The townspeople ask the Logician to clear up confusion, but his lengthy analysis makes no progress. The townspeople vow to stop the rhinos. Berenger expresses remorse for fighting with Jean, then says he's too upset to culture himself as planned and instead drinks."

Daisy believes they must adapt to their new neighbors, but Berenger proposes they regenerate the human race, like Adam and Eve. Daisy finds the power of the rhinos seductive. Berenger slaps her, then apologizes and declares that he'll never surrender and that he will protect her. She pledges her loyalty to him. The noise of the rhinos becomes more musical to Daisy, though Berenger still finds it savage and argues with her. Daisy breaks up with him and leaves. Berenger barricades his room and plugs his ears. He doubts his own humanity. He inspects photographs and cannot recognize any of his former friends—but he does identify himself and hangs three of his pictures on the wall beside the rhino heads. They turn out to be pictures of unattractive people and, compared to the elegant rhino heads, are even more grotesque. He envies the bodies of the rhinos, but at the brink of desperation, he nevertheless decides that he will fight the rhinos."

She informs them that Botard has metamorphosed. Berenger can't believe it, but then later rationalizes it. Daisy and Dudard iterate that acclimating oneself to the rhinos is the best solution, but Berenger resists. They start to have lunch, but are interrupted by a crumbling wall outside. The fire station has been sacked, and the firemen have turned into rhinos. Dudard leaves; he wants to experience the epidemic first-hand. Berenger tries to stop him, but Daisy lets him go. Dudard soon turns into a rhino outside. The sights and sounds of the rhinos become more beautiful despite their savagery. Berenger laments Dudard's demise, and Daisy reminds Berenger that they have no right to interfere in other's lives. She pours some brandy for Berenger and removes his bandage—still no signs of a transformation. Berenger claims he will defend her. He blames himself and Daisy for contributing, through lack of sympathy, to the transformations of Jean and Papillon, respectively. Daisy convinces him to shrug off the guilt.

They return to work, proof-reading law proposals, and wonder where co-worker Mr. Boeuf is. Mrs. Boeuf rushes in and says her husband is sick and will be back in a few days. She tells them that she was just chased by a rhino, which is now downstairs. The rhino crushes the staircase it tries to ascend, stranding the workers. Mrs. Boeuf recognizes the rhino as her husband. Daisy telephones the fire station to rescue them. The men give Mrs. Boeuf practical advice for dealing with this setback, but she is too devoted to her rhino-husband and vows to stay with him. She jumps down to the ground floor and (off-stage) rides off on his back. More rhinos are reported in the town. The firemen arrive to help them out the window.

Berenger takes another drink, under the premise that alcohol is an immunization. Dudard urges Berenger not to feel too guilty. Dudard reveals that Papillon, their boss, has turned into a rhinoceros. Berenger believes that for a man of Papillon's human stature to change, it must have been involuntary. Dudard considers the metamorphoses natural, while Berenger continues to find them abnormal. The flustered Berenger says he will seek the Logician's services in clearing this up. A herd of rhinos passes and Berenger spots the Logician's hat on a rhinoceros, a sign of metamorphosis, and vows not to become one as well."

He becomes more misanthropic and savage. Berenger informs him of Mr. Boeuf's transformation, which Jean applauds. He moves in and out of the bathroom, each time appearing and sounding more like a rhino. He pronounces humanism dead, sheds his itchy clothes, tries to run down Berenger, apologizes, and runs into the bathroom. Berenger is about to escape, but follows Jean into the bathroom to help him. Off-stage in the bathroom, Jean attacks Berenger. Berenger escapes and closes the bathroom door behind him (but is pierced by a rhino horn) as Jean, now a full-blown rhino, tries to break free. Berenger alerts the tenants in the building to the rhino's presence in the building, but everyone else has transformed as well. Berenger looks out the window, where a herd of rhinos march.

Richard IIWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/richardii/summary.html,"There is never an actual battle; instead, Bolingbroke peacefully takes Richard prisoner in Wales and brings him back to London, where Bolingbroke is crowned King Henry IV. Richard is imprisoned in the remote castle of Pomfret in the north of England, where he is left to ruminate upon his downfall. There, an assassin, who both is and is not acting upon King Henry's ambivalent wishes for Richard's expedient death, murders the former king. King Henry hypocritically repudiates the murderer and vows to journey to Jerusalem to cleanse himself of his part in Richard's death. As the play concludes, we see that the reign of the new King Henry IV has started off inauspiciously."
Richard IIWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/richardii/summary.html,"Richard II, written around 1595, is the first play in Shakespeare's second ""history tetralogy,"" a series of four plays that chronicles the rise of the house of Lancaster to the British throne. (Its sequel plays are Henry IV, Parts 1 & 2, and Henry V.) Richard II, set around the year 1398, traces the fall from power of the last king of the house of Plantagenet, Richard II, and his replacement by the first Lancaster king, Henry IV (Henry Bolingbroke). Richard II, who ascended to the throne as a young man, is a regal and stately figure, but he is wasteful in his spending habits, unwise in his choice of counselors, and detached from his country and its common people. He spends too much of his time pursuing the latest Italian fashions, spending money on his close friends, and raising taxes to fund his pet wars in Ireland and elsewhere. When he begins to ""rent out"" parcels of English land to certain wealthy noblemen in order to raise funds for one of his wars, and seizes the lands and money of a recently deceased and much respected uncle to help fill his coffers, both the commoners and the king's noblemen decide that Richard has gone too far."
Richard IIWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/richardii/summary.html,"Richard has a cousin, named Henry Bolingbroke, who is a great favorite among the English commoners. Early in the play, Richard exiles him from England for six years due to an unresolved dispute over an earlier political murder. The dead uncle whose lands Richard seizes was the father of Bolingbroke; when Bolingbroke learns that Richard has stolen what should have been his inheritance, it is the straw that breaks the camel's back. When Richard unwisely departs to pursue a war in Ireland, Bolingbroke assembles an army and invades the north coast of England in his absence. The commoners, fond of Bolingbroke and angry at Richard's mismanagement of the country, welcome his invasion and join his forces. One by one, Richard's allies in the nobility desert him and defect to Bolingbroke's side as Bolingbroke marches through England. By the time Richard returns from Ireland, he has already lost his grasp on his country."

Andy offers Hadley some financial advice by telling him to give the money to his wife as a one-time tax-free gift. Andy even offers to fill out the paperwork for Hadley in exchange for giving three beers to each prisoner on the work crew. After some initial hesitation and suspicion, Hadley agrees. The deal wins Andy the respect of everyone involved and makes him a mythic hero in the eyes of the prisoners. Andy also becomes a valuable financial resource to those who run the prison.

Robinson CrusoeDaniel Defoe,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crusoe/summary.html,"On December 19, 1686,
Crusoe boards the ship to return to England. There, he finds his
family is deceased except for two sisters. His widow friend has
kept Crusoe’s money safe, and after traveling to Lisbon, Crusoe
learns from the Portuguese captain that his plantations in Brazil
have been highly profitable. He arranges to sell his Brazilian lands.
Wary of sea travel, Crusoe attempts to return to England by land
but is threatened by bad weather and wild animals in northern Spain.
Finally arriving back in England, Crusoe receives word that the
sale of his plantations has been completed and that he has made
a considerable fortune. After donating a portion to the widow and
his sisters, Crusoe is restless and considers returning to Brazil,
but he is dissuaded by the thought that he would have to become
Catholic. He marries, and his wife dies. Crusoe finally departs
for the East Indies as a trader in 1694.
He revisits his island, finding that the Spaniards are governing
it well and that it has become a prosperous colony."
Robinson CrusoeDaniel Defoe,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crusoe/summary.html,"One day Crusoe is shocked to discover a man’s footprint
on the beach. He first assumes the footprint is the devil’s, then
decides it must belong to one of the cannibals said to live in the
region. Terrified, he arms himself and remains on the lookout for
cannibals. He also builds an underground cellar in which to herd
his goats at night and devises a way to cook underground. One evening
he hears gunshots, and the next day he is able to see a ship wrecked
on his coast. It is empty when he arrives on the scene to investigate.
Crusoe once again thanks Providence for having been saved. Soon
afterward, Crusoe discovers that the shore has been strewn with
human carnage, apparently the remains of a cannibal feast. He is
alarmed and continues to be vigilant. Later Crusoe catches sight
of thirty cannibals heading for shore with their victims. One of
the victims is killed. Another one, waiting to be slaughtered, suddenly
breaks free and runs toward Crusoe’s dwelling. Crusoe protects him,
killing one of the pursuers and injuring the other, whom the victim
finally kills. Well-armed, Crusoe defeats most of the cannibals
onshore. The victim vows total submission to Crusoe in gratitude
for his liberation. Crusoe names him Friday, to commemorate the
day on which his life was saved, and takes him as his servant."
Robinson CrusoeDaniel Defoe,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crusoe/summary.html,"Robinson Crusoe is an Englishman from
the town of York in the seventeenth century, the youngest son of
a merchant of German origin. Encouraged by his father to study law,
Crusoe expresses his wish to go to sea instead. His family is against
Crusoe going out to sea, and his father explains that it is better
to seek a modest, secure life for oneself. Initially, Robinson is
committed to obeying his father, but he eventually succumbs to temptation
and embarks on a ship bound for London with a friend. When a storm
causes the near deaths of Crusoe and his friend, the friend is dissuaded
from sea travel, but Crusoe still goes on to set himself up as merchant
on a ship leaving London. This trip is financially successful, and
Crusoe plans another, leaving his early profits in the care of a
friendly widow. The second voyage does not prove as fortunate: the
ship is seized by Moorish pirates, and Crusoe is enslaved to a potentate
in the North African town of Sallee. While on a fishing expedition,
he and a slave boy break free and sail down the African coast. A
kindly Portuguese captain picks them up, buys the slave boy from
Crusoe, and takes Crusoe to Brazil. In Brazil, Crusoe establishes
himself as a plantation owner and soon becomes successful. Eager
for slave labor and its economic advantages, he embarks on a slave-gathering expedition
to West Africa but ends up shipwrecked off of the coast of Trinidad."
Robinson CrusoeDaniel Defoe,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crusoe/summary.html,"Crusoe soon learns he is the sole survivor of the expedition
and seeks shelter and food for himself. He returns to the wreck’s
remains twelve times to salvage guns, powder, food, and other items. Onshore,
he finds goats he can graze for meat and builds himself a shelter.
He erects a cross that he inscribes with the date of his arrival, September 1, 1659,
and makes a notch every day in order never to lose track of time.
He also keeps a journal of his household activities, noting his
attempts to make candles, his lucky discovery of sprouting grain,
and his construction of a cellar, among other events. In June 1660,
he falls ill and hallucinates that an angel visits, warning him
to repent. Drinking tobacco-steeped rum, Crusoe experiences a religious
illumination and realizes that God has delivered him from his earlier
sins. After recovering, Crusoe makes a survey of the area and discovers
he is on an island. He finds a pleasant valley abounding in grapes,
where he builds a shady retreat. Crusoe begins to feel more optimistic
about being on the island, describing himself as its “king.” He
trains a pet parrot, takes a goat as a pet, and develops skills
in basket weaving, bread making, and pottery. He cuts down an enormous
cedar tree and builds a huge canoe from its trunk, but he discovers
that he cannot move it to the sea. After building a smaller boat,
he rows around the island but nearly perishes when swept away by
a powerful current. Reaching shore, he hears his parrot calling
his name and is thankful for being saved once again. He spends several
years in peace."
Robinson CrusoeDaniel Defoe,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crusoe/summary.html,"Finding Friday cheerful and intelligent, Crusoe teaches
him some English words and some elementary Christian concepts. Friday,
in turn, explains that the cannibals are divided into distinct nations and
that they only eat their enemies. Friday also informs Crusoe that the
cannibals saved the men from the shipwreck Crusoe witnessed earlier,
and that those men, Spaniards, are living nearby. Friday expresses
a longing to return to his people, and Crusoe is upset at the prospect
of losing Friday. Crusoe then entertains the idea of making contact
with the Spaniards, and Friday admits that he would rather die than
lose Crusoe. The two build a boat to visit the cannibals’ land together.
Before they have a chance to leave, they are surprised by the arrival
of twenty-one cannibals in canoes. The cannibals are holding three
victims, one of whom is in European dress. Friday and Crusoe kill
most of the cannibals and release the European, a Spaniard. Friday
is overjoyed to discover that another of the rescued victims is
his father. The four men return to Crusoe’s dwelling for food and
rest. Crusoe prepares to welcome them into his community permanently.
He sends Friday’s father and the Spaniard out in a canoe to explore
the nearby land."
Robinson CrusoeDaniel Defoe,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/crusoe/summary.html,"Eight days later, the sight of an approaching English
ship alarms Friday. Crusoe is suspicious. Friday and Crusoe watch
as eleven men take three captives onshore in a boat. Nine of the
men explore the land, leaving two to guard the captives. Friday
and Crusoe overpower these men and release the captives, one of
whom is the captain of the ship, which has been taken in a mutiny.
Shouting to the remaining mutineers from different points, Friday
and Crusoe confuse and tire the men by making them run from place
to place. Eventually they confront the mutineers, telling them that
all may escape with their lives except the ringleader. The men surrender.
Crusoe and the captain pretend that the island is an imperial territory
and that the governor has spared their lives in order to send them
all to England to face justice. Keeping five men as hostages, Crusoe
sends the other men out to seize the ship. When the ship is brought
in, Crusoe nearly faints."

Herod refuses, calling the servants to bring the festivities outside. Herod slips on the blood of the Syrian and gasps at the ill omen. The Soldiers feign that they do not know why he killed himself."
SaloméOscar Wilde,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/salome/summary.html,"The Syrian exclaims that Salomé approaches. She enters, insisting that she cannot stay with Herod looking at her all the while ""with his mole's eyes under his shaking eyelids."" To the Page's horror, the Syrian invites her to sit. Salomé welcomes the moon, cold and chaste, with a virgin's beauty. Jokanaan again announces the coming of the Lord. Salomé asks if he is the prophet Herod fears, the prophet who maligns her mother. As Jokanaan preaches on, Salomé insists that she speak to him. All attempt to dissuade her. She plies the Syrian to bring the prophet forth."
SaloméOscar Wilde,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/salome/summary.html,"Herod falls back and the Soldier bears his death ring to the frightened Executioner. Moments later, a huge black arm emerges from the cistern, bearing Jokanaan's head on a silver shield. Salomé seizes it and tells the head that she will kiss its mouth now. But she wonders why Jokanaan refuses to look at her. He saw his God but never saw her. She hungers for his body, and nothing will quench her. She was a virgin, and she took his virginity. If he had looked at her, he would have loved her, and love's mystery is greater than death's."
SaloméOscar Wilde,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/salome/summary.html,"The play unfolds on the terrace of Herod's palace above the banquet hall. A gigantic staircase stands to the left; a cistern surrounded by a wall of green bronze appears at the back. The Young Syrian exclaims how Salomé is beautiful tonight. It is as if she was dancing. ""Look at the moon!"" cries Herodias' Page, comparing it to a woman rising from her tomb, a woman ""looking for dead things."" He warns the Syrian that he looks at the princess too much. A noise is heard in the hall, and the Soldiers complain that the Jews are howling again about their religion. The First Soldier observes that the Tetrarch (King Herod) has a ""somber look,"" and the soldiers wonder at whom he is looking."
SaloméOscar Wilde,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/salome/summary.html,"The prophet emerges, and Salomé looks at him. Salomé exclaims that the prophet's eyes are terrible above all, like ""black lakes troubled by fantastic moons."" He is a wasted ""ivory statue,"" chaste like the moon. ""Who is this woman who is looking at me?"" protests Jokenaan, bidding Salomé begone. Salomé implores the prophet to speak on: his voice is like wine. She is ""amorous of his body."" Jokanaan curses her anew. Begging Salomé to stop, the Syrian kills himself and falls between the prophet and princess. Salomé continues to ask Jokanaan to let her kiss him. He orders her to seek the Lord, refuses to look upon her, and descends into the cistern."

Whether Tamkin is fraudulent and questionable as a psychologist, and whether he is a liar and a charlatan is a question that is constantly being posed to us. Regardless, Tamkin is quite charming and appeals to Tommy. Dr. Tamkin claims to be a poet, a healer, a member of the Detroit Purple Gang, as well as claiming a number of other positions and titles. Despite his lies, he gives Tommy kernels of truth that become significant in the novella and for Tommy. Moreover, Tommy entrusts Tamkin with the last of his savings to invest in the commodities market, since Tamkin claims a certain stock market expertise."

The novella traverses one very important day in the life of this self-same Tommy Wilhelm: his ""day of reckoning,"" so to speak."
Seize the DaySaul Bellow,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/seize/summary.html,"The reader begins to discover through Tommy's thoughts and through a series of flashbacks that Tommy has just recently been fired from his job as a salesman, he is a college drop-out, a man with two children, recently separated from his wife, and he is a man on the brink of financial disaster. Tommy has just given over the last of his savings to the fraudulent Dr. Tamkin, who has promised to knowingly invest it in the commodities market. Amid all of this, he has, apparently, fallen in love with a woman named Olive, who he cannot marry because his wife will not grant him a divorce. Tommy is unhappy and in need of assistance both emotionally and financially."

Seize the DaySaul Bellow,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/seize/summary.html,"The rest of the novella consists of Tommy and Dr. Tamkin traveling back and forth to and from the stock market, meeting several characters along the way. The novel finally illustrates Tommy's terrible loss in the commodities in which Tamkin has invested Tommy's money. Tommy has lost all of his savings but still has the monetary demands of his family to meet. Furthermore, Tamkin has disappeared. After an attempt to look for Tamkin in his room at the hotel, the novella comes to a close with three climaxes—two minor and one large, final climax."

The flashbacks highlight, among other things, Tommy's meeting with the duplicitous Maurice Venice, the talent scout who shows initial interest in a young Tommy and his good looks. Wilhelm, however, is later rejected by the same scout after a failed screen test but nevertheless attempts a career in Hollywood as an actor. He discontinues his college education and moves to California, against his parent's will and warnings."

Full of rage, he exits out onto Broadway where he believes to see Dr. Tamkin at a funeral, nearby. He calls out to Tamkin but receives no reply. Suddenly he is swept in by a rush of people and finds himself carried into a crowd within the chapel where the funeral is taking place. It is here that the final climax comes because Tommy finds himself before the body of a dead stranger, unable to break away and he begins to cry and weep. He releases pools of emotion and ""crie[s] with all his heart."" It is here that the book ends. Other people at the funeral are confused as to who he is, wondering how close he had been to the deceased.

all forms of life are interconnected in a cycle without beginning
or end. Birth and death are all part of a timeless unity. Life and
death, joy and sorrow, good and evil are all parts of the whole

Siddhartha to teach him what he knows. Siddhartha explains that
neither he nor anyone can teach the wisdom to Govinda, because verbal

He has noticed a contradiction in Gotama’s teachings: Siddhartha
questions how one can embrace the unity of all things, as the Buddha
asks, if they are also being told to overcome the physical world.

solution for him. He points out that the oldest Samanas have lived
the life for many years but have yet to attain true spiritual enlightenment.
The Samanas have been as unsuccessful as the Brahmins Siddhartha

begin to hear about a new holy man named Gotama the Buddha who has
attained the total spiritual enlightenment called Nirvana. Govinda

The novel dwells on the moment as it is experienced; the characters are plunged into the narrative without the reader being told much, if any, of their histories. Their identities are constantly subject to change, reflecting the modern American experience that had been ushered in by the developing capitalist economy. In the process of this development, thousands of rural Americans rushed to the cities to find jobs and to build themselves new lives and identities. Sister Carrie captures the excitement of that experience."
Sister CarrieTheodore Dreiser,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sistercarrie/summary.html,"Sister Carrie tells the story of two characters: Carrie Meeber, an ordinary girl who rises from a low-paid wage earner to a high-paid actress, and George Hurstwood, a member of the upper middle class who falls from his comfortable lifestyle to a life on the streets. Neither Carrie nor Hurstwood earn their fates through virtue or vice, but rather through random circumstance. Their successes and failures have no moral value; this stance marks Sister Carrie as a departure from the conventional literature of the period."

says nothing of his experiences. In 1968,
he gets on a chartered plane to go to an optometry conference in
Montreal. The plane crashes into a mountain, and, among the optometrists,
only Billy survives. A brain surgeon operates on him in a Vermont
hospital. On her way to visit him there, Valencia dies of accidental
carbon monoxide poisoning after crashing her car. Billy’s daughter
places him under the care of a nurse back home in Ilium. But he

of his account of his death, which he predicts will occur in 1976 after
Chicago has been hydrogen-bombed by the Chinese. He knows exactly
how it will happen: a vengeful man he knew in the war will hire
someone to shoot him. Billy adds that he will experience the violet
hum of death and then will skip back to some other point in his

Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"The authorities began to investigate the case the next
day, when Carl’s boat was found adrift off the island. The investigation
was under the jurisdiction of Art Moran, the local sheriff. The
coroner, Horace Whaley, a World War II veteran himself, remarked
to the sheriff that Carl’s head wound resembled wounds he had seen inflicted
by Japanese soldiers skilled in the martial art of kendo. Though
Art had at first thought that Carl’s death was purely an accident,
Horace’s comment led him to investigate more closely. The evidence,
though circumstantial, seemed to point directly to Kabuo. Not only
was Kabuo an expert in kendo, but upon searching Kabuo’s boat, Art
found a fishing gaff with blood on the handle—blood that, when tested,
proved to be of the same relatively rare blood type as Carl’s."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"Still undecided about the land sale, Carl went out in
his fishing boat on the foggy night of September 15, 1954.
His boat ran out of power during the night, leaving him stranded
in dense fog in the middle of a shipping channel, a perilous place
to be because of the huge freighters that frequently passed through
the channel. Fortuitously, Kabuo came upon Carl’s boat and helped
him. Grateful for Kabuo’s kindness, Carl overcame his prejudices
and agreed to sell the land to Kabuo."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"The elder Carl died soon after the Miyamotos were sent
away. Etta, disgusted with the idea that anyone of Japanese descent
would ever own her husband’s land, promptly sold the land to a white farmer,
Ole Jurgensen, at a higher price than the Miyamotos had paid. When
Kabuo returned from the war, he sought to recover the land he felt
his family deserved. However, since Ole Jurgensen now owned the
land, Kabuo had no choice but to wait patiently until Ole was ready
to sell. When Ole finally advertised his farm for sale after suffering
a stroke, Kabuo thought that the moment had arrived and rushed to
make an offer for the land as soon as he heard that it was available."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"In contrast to Carl, Ishmael Chambers, another war veteran
who is about the same age as Carl, makes his living through words.
He is the editor of the town newspaper, the San Piedro Review, a
position he inherited from his father, Arthur. Yet Ishmael remains
silent about one aspect of his personal history, the romantic relationship he
once had with a young Japanese-American girl named Hatsue, who is
now Kabuo’s wife. Ishmael struggles with his memories of this relationship,
unable to understand why the beautiful Hatsue, who had been so close
to him, abruptly called off the relationship and has treated him
with coldness ever since."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"During the trial, there is little overt expression of
racism against Kabuo as a Japanese-American, but it is clear that
racism pervades the proceedings. Beneath San Piedro’s seeming tranquility
and stillness smolders a tension between the island’s white residents
and its Japanese-American community. During the war, the white residents of
San Piedro stood by silently while their Japanese-American neighbors
were loaded onto ferries and sent to internment camps. The passive
hatred and prejudice common on San Piedro did not originate with
the war hysteria, however. Rather, the war merely unleashed and
legitimized decades-old prejudices that had previously been suppressed
under San Piedro’s ethos of silence and avoidance of confrontation."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"Because San Piedro is a small, isolated island, its residents
are extremely careful not to make enemies within their community. Over
the years, this caution has cultivated a brooding quiet throughout
the island. Carl Heine is an archetypal San Piedro native, silently
hoarding his feelings and words as if they were precious nuggets
of gold. Carl has returned from World War II with the stony silence
of a veteran."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"There remains no incontrovertible proof of Kabuo’s innocence until
Ishmael Chambers stumbles across a logbook from a local lighthouse
on the evening of the second day of the trial. The logbook, kept
by a radioman’s assistant who is no longer stationed on San Piedro,
records that a large freighter got lost in dense fog off the island
on the night of September 15, 1954—the
same night Carl died. The radioman, attempting to guide the freighter
back on course, advised its crew to steer the huge ship directly
through the channel where Carl was fishing that night. According
to the logbook, the freighter passed through Carl’s area at 1:42 A.M.,
just five minutes before Carl’s waterlogged watch stopped at 1:47 A.M.—the
moment Carl plunged, unconscious, into the water. It is clear to
Ishmael that the freighter’s wake, not Kabuo, is responsible for
Carl’s death."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"Ishmael sits on the report through the trial’s closing
statements. The prosecutor, Alvin Hooks, subtly appeals to the jurors’
prejudice in his closing statement, exhorting them to look at Kabuo’s
stone-faced expression when deciding his guilt. Kabuo’s attorney,
Nels Gudmundsson, directly addresses the matter of prejudice and
urges the jury to decide objectively."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"While Kabuo’s trial takes place, the novel repeatedly
flashes back in time to episodes that took place years before, interspersing
these past events between testimonies and statements given during
the trial. During the war, Etta Heine, Carl’s rabidly anti-Japanese mother,
took advantage of the Miyamoto family’s absence to break an agreement
her husband made years earlier. Under this agreement, Etta’s husband,
Carl Heine Sr., had agreed to sell seven acres of his land to Kabuo’s
father, Zenhichi. The agreement had been informal, since laws at
the time forbade Japanese-born residents from purchasing or owning
land. Zenhichi made his biannual payments for the land religiously
and was just two payments away from full ownership when his family
was sent to an internment camp."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"The discovery of the report leaves Ishmael tortured with
indecision. He knows that as an honest man and especially as a reporter, he
is obligated to come forward with any information that bears relevance
to the trial. However, Ishmael still struggles with intense bitterness
as Hatsue’s jilted lover. Ishmael recognizes his intense desire for
revenge against Hatsue for breaking his heart."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"Unfortunately, Carl died later that night in a freak
accident. A large freighter passing through the shipping channel
created an enormous wake, a wall of waves high enough to jar Carl’s
boat violently. Carl, who had been cutting a lantern loose from
his mast, was knocked down from the mast and hit his head on the
edge of his boat. Knocked unconscious, he fell into the water and
drowned."

one day before the thirteenth anniversary of the Japanese bombing
of Pearl Harbor. Kabuo faces the courtroom silently and with a stiff,
upright posture, which the white residents of San Piedro in the

Nonetheless, Kabuo already regards himself as a murderer in a sense.
A veteran of World War II himself—having fought for the American
side, not the Japanese—he broods over his memories of the enemy
soldiers he killed during the war. Kabuo has settled into a quiet
acceptance of that guilt, but he has also nurtured an appreciation
of his wife and children as marvelous, undeserved gifts."
Snow Falling on CedarsDavid Guterson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cedars/summary.html,"Kabuo found that Carl Heine had beaten him to it; Carl
had already made arrangements to purchase Ole’s land. Hearing Kabuo’s
pleas, however, Carl agreed to consider selling Kabuo a portion
of the land, the small plot that Zenhichi had originally attempted
to purchase. Kabuo held out hope that Carl would in fact decide
to offer him the land, since he and Carl had been childhood friends.
However, Kabuo knew that Carl, though at heart a good man, had struggled
with anti-Japanese prejudices ever since the war."

Roland proudly refuses to do so, claiming that they need no help, that the rear guard can easily take on the pagan hordes. While the Franks fight magnificently, there's no way they can continue to hold off against the Saracens, and the battle begins to turn clearly against them. Almost all his men are dead and Roland knows that it's now too late for Charlemagne and his troops to save them, but he blows his oliphant anyway, so that the emperor can see what happened to his men and avenge them.

He tells the Saracens how they could ambush the rear guard of Charlemagne's army, which will surely be led by Roland as the Franks pick their way back to Spain through the mountain passes, and helps the Saracens plan their attack."

grandfather’s ancestral home in Virginia. Milkman does not know
that he is being followed by Guitar, who wants to murder Milkman
because he believes that Milkman has cheated him out of his share
of the gold. While Milkman initially feels uncomfortable in Shalimar’s
small-town atmosphere, he grows to love it as he uncovers more and
more clues about his family history. Milkman finds that Jake’s father,
his great-grandfather, was the legendary flying African, Solomon,
who escaped slavery by flying back to Africa. Although Solomon’s
flight was miraculous, it left a scar on his family that has lasted
for generations. After an unsuccessful attempt to take Jake, his
youngest son, with him on the flight, Solomon abandoned his wife,
Ryna, and their twenty-one children. Unable to cope without a husband,
Ryna went insane, leaving Jake to be raised by Heddy, an Indian
woman whose daughter, Sing, he married."

who is driven mad by his rejection and tries to kill Milkman on
multiple occasions. After arriving in Montour County, Pennsylvania,
Milkman discovers that there is no gold to be found. He looks for
his long-lost family history rather than for gold. Milkman meets
Circe, an old midwife who helped deliver Macon Jr. and Pilate. Circe

disease that has its origins in oppressions endured by past generations
and passed on to future ones. Milkman’s grandfather, Macon Dead, received
his odd name when a drunk Union soldier erroneously filled out his
documents (his grandfather’s given name remains unknown to Milkman).
Eventually, Macon was killed while defending his land. His two children,
Macon Jr. and Pilate, were irreversibly scarred by witnessing the
murder and became estranged from each other. Pilate has become a
poor but strong and independent woman, the mother of a family that
includes her daughter, Reba, and her granddaughter, Hagar. In contrast,
Macon Jr. spends his time acquiring wealth. Both his family and
his tenants revile him."

to Michigan to tell Macon Jr. and Pilate about his discoveries.
At home, he finds that Hagar has died of a broken heart and that
the emotional problems plaguing his family have not gone away. Nevertheless,
Milkman accompanies Pilate back to Shalimar, where they bury Jake’s
bones on Solomon’s Leap, the mountain from which Solomon’s flight
to Africa began. Immediately after Jake’s burial, Pilate is struck
dead by a bullet that Guitar had intended for Milkman. Heartbroken

he promises a share of the loot, Milkman robs Pilate. Inside the
green tarp, Milkman and Guitar find only some rocks and a human
skeleton. We later learn that the skeleton is that of Milkman’s
grandfather, Macon Dead I. Guitar is especially disappointed not
to find the gold because he needs the funds to carry out his mission
for the Seven Days, a secret society that avenges injustices committed
against African-Americans by murdering innocent whites."

Sophie's WorldJostein Gaarder,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sophie/summary.html,"Then, as Sophie's education continues, the Hilde situation begins to get more complicated. She finds many more postcards to Hilde, and some of them are even dated on June 15, the day of Sophie will turn 15. The problem is that June 15 is still over a month away. She discovers some of this with her best friend Joanna, and one of the postcards tells Hilde that one day she will meet Sophie and also mentions Joanna. Strange things are happening that the girls cannot figure out. Sophie's relationship with her mother becomes somewhat strained as she tries both to cover up the correspondence with Alberto and to practice her philosophical thinking on her mom. Meanwhile, Alberto teaches Sophie about Jesus and the meeting of Indo-European and Semitic culture. She learns about St. Augustine, St. Aquinas, and the christianization of Greek philosophy that occurred in the Middle Ages. By this time, Sophie has met Alberto and he begins hinting that the philosophy is about to get extremely relevant to the strange things that are happening to her."
Sophie's WorldJostein Gaarder,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sophie/summary.html,"Sophie Amundsen is fourteen years old when the book begins, living in Norway. She begins a strange correspondence course in philosophy. Every day, a letter comes to her mailbox that contains a few questions and then later in the day a package comes with some typed pages describing the ideas of a philosopher who dealt with the issues raised by the questions. Although at first she does not know, later on Sophie learns that Alberto Knox is the name of the philosopher who is teaching her. He sends her packages via his dog Hermes. Alberto first tells Sophie that philosophy is extremely relevant to life and that if we do not question and ponder our very existence we are not really living. Then he proceeds to go through the history of western philosophy. Alberto teaches Sophie about the ancient myths that people had in the days before they tried to come up with natural explanations for the processes in the world. Then she learns about the natural philosophers who were concerned with change. Next Alberto describes Democritus and the theory of indivisible atoms underlying all of nature as well as the concept of fate."
Sophie's WorldJostein Gaarder,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sophie/summary.html,"At the same time as she takes the philosophy course, Sophie receives a strange postcard sent to Hilde Møller Knag, care of Sophie. The postcard is from Hilde's father and wishes Hilde happy birthday. Sophie is confused, and moreso when she finds a scarf with Hilde's name on it. She does not know what is happening but she is sure that Hilde and the philosophy course must somehow be connected. She learns about Socrates, who was wise enough to know that he knew nothing. Then Alberto sends her a video that shows him in present day Athens and somehow he seems to go back in time to ancient Athens. She learns about Plato and his world of ideas and then about Aristotle, who critiqued Plato, classified much of the natural world, and founded logic and our theory of concepts."
Sophie's WorldJostein Gaarder,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sophie/summary.html,"Sophie learns about the focus on humanity in the Renaissance and the extremes of the Baroque and then Alberto focuses on some key philosophers. Urgently, he teaches her about Descartes, who doubted, and by doing so knew at least that he could doubt. They move on to Spinoza as it becomes clear that Hilde's father has some awesome power over them. Then Sophie learns about the empiricists. Locke believed in natural rights and that everything we know is gained from experience. Hume, an important influence on Kant, showed that our actions are guided by feelings and warned against making laws based upon our experiences. But Berkeley is most important to Sophie because he suggested that perhaps our entire lives were inside the mind of God. And Alberto says that their lives are inside the mind of Albert Knag, Hilde's father."
Sophie's WorldJostein Gaarder,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sophie/summary.html,"At this point the story switches to Hilde's point of view. On June 15, the day she turns fifteen, Hilde receives a birthday gift from her father entitled Sophie's World. She begins to read and is enthralled. We follow the rest of Sophie's story from Hilde's perspective. Hilde becomes certain that Sophie exists, that she is not just a character in a book. Alberto has a plan to escape Albert Knag's mind, and they must finish the philosophy course before that can happen. He teaches Sophie about the Enlightenment and its humane values and about Kant and his unification of empiricist and rationalist thought. Things in Sophie's life have become completely insane but she and Alberto know they must figure out a way to do something. It will have to occur on the night of June 15, when Hilde's father returns home. They learn about the world spirit of Romanticism, Hegel's dialectical view of history, and Kierkegaard's belief that the individual's existence is primary. Meanwhile, Hilde plans a surprise for her father on his return home. They rush through Marx, Darwin, Freud, and Sartre, desperate to come up with a plan to escape even though everything they do is known by Hilde's father. Then at the end of Sophie's World, the book that Hilde is reading, while at a party for Sophie on June 15, Alberto and Sophie disappear. Hilde's father comes home and they talk about the book, and Hilde is sure that Sophie exists somewhere. Meanwhile, Sophie and Alberto have a new existence as spirit—they have escaped from Albert Knag's mind but they are invisible to other people and can walk right through them. Sophie wants to try to interfere in the world of Hilde and her father, and at the end of the book she is learning how to do so."

But a dispute ensues between Horatio and Lorenzo, the son of the Duke of Castile and brother of Bel-Imperia, as to who actually captured the prince. The King of Spain decides to compromise between the two, letting Horatio have the ransom money to be paid for Balthazar and Lorenzo keep the captured prince at his home. Back in Portugal, the Viceroy (ruler) is mad with grief, for he believes his son to be dead, and is tricked by Villuppo into arresting an innocent noble, Alexandro, for Balthazar's murder.

Hieronimo is given responsibility over the entertainment for the marriage ceremony, and he uses it to exact his revenge. He devises a play, a tragedy, to be performed at the ceremonies, and convinces Lorenzo and Balthazar to act in it. Bel-Imperia, by now a confederate in Hieronimo's plot for revenge, also acts in the play. Just before the play is acted, Isabella, insane with grief, kills herself."
Spanish TragedyThomas Kyd,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/spanishtragedy/summary.html,"Upon being taken back to Spain, Balthazar soon falls in love with Bel-Imperia himself. But, as her servant Pedringano reveals to him, Bel-Imperia is in love with Horatio, who returns her affections. The slight against him, which is somewhat intentional on Bel-Imperia's part, enrages Balthazar. Horatio also incurs the hatred of Lorenzo, because of the fight over Balthazar's capture and the fact that the lower-born Horatio (the son of a civil servant) now consorts with Lorenzo's sister. So the two nobles decide to kill Horatio, which they successfully do with the aid of Pedringano and Balthazar's servant Serberine, during an evening rende-vous between the two lovers. Bel-Imperia is then taken away before Hieronimo stumbles on to the scene to discover his dead son. He is soon joined in uncontrollable grief by his wife, Isabella."

Spanish TragedyThomas Kyd,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/spanishtragedy/summary.html,"The plot of the tragedy mirrors the plot of the play as a whole (a sultan is driven to murder a noble friend through jealousy over a woman).

During the action of the play, Hieronimo's character stabs Lorenzo's character and Bel-Imperia's character stabs Balthazar's character, before killing herself. But after the play is over, Hieronimo reveals to the horrified wedding guests (while standing over the corpse of his own son) that all the stabbings in the play were done with real knives, and that Lorenzo, Balthazar, and Bel-Imperia are now all dead.

When he faces the judges who are supposed to assign him to his place in the underworld, they are unable to reach a decision and instead send him to the palace of Pluto and Proserpine, King and Queen of the Underworld. Proserpine decides that Revenge should accompany him back to the world of the living, and, after passing through the gates of horn, this is where he finds himself. The spirit of Revenge promises that by the play's end, Don Andrea will see his revenge."
Spanish TragedyThomas Kyd,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/spanishtragedy/summary.html,"In Portugal, Alexandro escapes death when the Portuguese ambassador returns from Spain with news that Balthazar still lives; Villuppo is then sentenced to death. In Spain, Hieronimo is almost driven insane by his inability to find justice for his son. Hieronimo receives a bloody letter in Bel-Imperia's hand, identifying the murderers as Lorenzo and Balthazar, but he is uncertain whether or not to believe it. While Hieronimo is racked with grief, Lorenzo grows worried by Hieronimo's erratic behavior and acts in a Machiavellian manner to eliminate all evidence surrounding his crime. He tells Pedringano to kill Serberine for gold but arranges it so that Pedringano is immediately arrested after the crime. He then leads Pedringano to believe that a pardon for his crime is hidden in a box brought to the execution by a messenger boy, a belief that prevents Pedringano from exposing Lorenzo before he is hanged. Negotiations continue between Spain and Portugal, now centering on a diplomatic marriage between Balthazar and Bel-Imperia to unite the royal lines of the two countries. Ironically, a letter is found on Pedringano's body that confirms Hieronimo's suspicion over Lorenzo and Balthazar, but Lorenzo is able to deny Hieronimo access to the king, thus making royal justice unavailable to the distressed father. Hieronimo then vows to revenge himself privately on the two killers, using deception and a false show of friendship to keep Lorenzo off his guard."

They develop a magician's act that exhibits Mike's powers and join a carnival, but despite Mike's amazing abilities, he lacks a sense of showmanship, and they are fired. A Fosterite tattooed lady in the carnival, Patty Paiwonski, goes to visit them at their hotel room, hoping to convert them before they leave.

Stranger in a Strange LandRobert A. Heinlein,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/strangeland/summary.html,"Humankind sends its first human expedition to Mars. The spaceship's crew arrives on the planet and are never heard from again. Twenty-five years later, another mission is sent, and the child of two of the first ship's crewmembers, who has been born on Mars and raised by the peculiar Martian race, is discovered and brought back to Earth. Because of various legal precedents, Valentine Michael Smith, the Man from Mars, is the inheritor to a vast fortune, and because of another precedent known as the Larkin Decision, Mike has a claim to legal ownership of the planet Mars. Therefore he has the potential to be massively influential in matters of Earth politics, and he is kept under close guard at a hospital by the leader of Earth's government, Secretary General Joseph Douglas. In the hospital, Mike slowly teaches his body to adapt to the Earth's atmosphere and he begins learning Earth culture and language, which differ enormously from Martian ways of thought."

When Mike's temple is burned down, Jubal rushes to see him. Though Jubal loves Mike, he has resisted visiting Mike's church. Jubal's philosophies are all deeply individualist, and Jubal, like Ben, is unnerved by the cultism of Mike's operation.

Jubal lives in a large house with three beautiful secretaries (Anne, Miriam, and Dorcas) and two male assistants (Duke and Larry). Jubal agrees to help protect Jill and Mike from the authorities. Mike learns about Earth culture at Jubal's estate, reading everything in Jubal's library and becoming fascinated with Earth religions. The police eventually discover Mike's whereabouts and come to arrest Jubal and his coterie, but at the last moment, Jubal is able to get through to Douglas personally and convince him to call off the police. Jubal also gets Douglas to rescue Ben from police captivity. Through legalistic maneuvering and rhetorical brinksmanship, Jubal is able to defuse Mike's political importance, arguing that Mike cannot be the legal owner of Mars since the Martian race inhabited it long before Mike was born. Jubal makes Douglas an ally by convincing him to become overseer of Mike's vast personal fortune."

Nel is the product of a family that believes deeply in social conventions; hers is a stable home, though some might characterize it as rigid. Nel is uncertain of the conventional life her mother, Helene, wants for her; these doubts are hammered home when she meets Rochelle, her grandmother and a former prostitute, the only unconventional woman in her family line. Sula's family is very different: she lives with her grandmother, Eva, and her mother, Hannah, both of whom are seen by the town as eccentric and loose. Their house also serves as a home for three informally adopted boys and a steady stream of borders."
Sula,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sula/summary.html,"In 1965, with the Bottom facing the prospect of the white golf course, Nel visits Eva in the nursing home. Eva accuses her of sharing the guilt for Chicken Little's death. Her accusation forces Nel to confront the unfairness of her judgment against Sula. Nel admits to herself that she had blamed his death entirely on Sula and set herself up as the ""good"" half of the relationship. Nel comes to realize that in the aftermath of Chicken Little's death she had too quickly clung to social convention in an effort to define herself as ""good."" Nel goes to the cemetery and mourns at Sula's grave, calling out Sula's name in sadness."
Sula,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sula/summary.html,"Despite their differences, Sula and Nel become fiercely attached to each other during adolescence. However, a traumatic accident changes everything. One day, Sula playfully swings a neighborhood boy, Chicken Little, around by his hands. When she loses her grip, the boy falls into a nearby river and drowns. They never tell anyone about the accident even though they did not intend to harm the boy. The two girls begin to grow apart. One day, in an accident, Sula's mother's dress catches fire and she dies of the burns."

She has many affairs, some with white men. However, she finds people following the same boring routines elsewhere, so she returns to the Bottom and to Nel."
Sula,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sula/summary.html,"Sula is a novel about ambiguity. It questions and examines the terms ""good"" and ""evil,"" often demonstrating that the two often resemble one another. The novel addresses the confusing mysteries of human emotions and relationships, ultimately concluding that social conventions are inadequate as a foundation for living one's life. The novel tempts the reader to apply the diametrically opposed terms of ""good and evil,"" ""right and wrong"" to the characters and their actions, and yet simultaneously shows why it is necessary to resist such temptation. While exploring the ways in which people try to make meaning of lives filled with conflicts over race, gender, and simple idiosyncratic points of views, Sula resists easy answers, demonstrating the ambiguity, beauty, and terror of life, in both its triumphs and horrors."
Sula,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sula/summary.html,"The Bottom is a mostly black community in Ohio, situated in the hills above the mostly white, wealthier community of Medallion. The Bottom first became a community when a master gave it to his former slave. This ""gift"" was in fact a trick: the master gave the former slave a poor stretch of hilly land, convincing the slave the land was worthwhile by claiming that because it was hilly, it was closer to heaven. The trick, though, led to the growth of a vibrant community. Now the community faces a new threat; wealthy whites have taken a liking to the land, and would like to destroy much of the town in order to build a golf course."
Sula,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sula/summary.html,"Upon her return, the town regards Sula as the very personification of evil for her blatant disregard of social conventions. Their hatred in part rests upon Sula's interracial relationships, but is crystallized when Sula has an affair with Nel's husband, Jude, who subsequently abandons Nel. Ironically, the community's labeling of Sula as evil actually improves their own lives. Her presence in the community gives them the impetus to live harmoniously with one another. Nel breaks off her friendship with Sula. Just before Sula dies in 1940, they achieve a half-hearted reconciliation. With Sula's death, the harmony that had reigned in the town quickly dissolves."

Super-Frog Saves TokyoHaruki Murakami,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/super-frog-saves-tokyo/summary.html,"On February 15, 1995, Katagiri, a longtime collections officer for the Tokyo Security Trust Bank, is surprised to find a giant frog waiting for him politely outside his apartment. Frog introduces himself and apologizes for barging into Katagiri’s home, claiming to have an urgent matter to discuss. He has come because Tokyo is about to be destroyed. Katagiri thinks that it must be a prank, but Frog assures him that they are the only ones present. Frog tells him that he isn’t crazy and that Katagiri isn’t dreaming. Confused and overwhelmed, Katagiri asks whether Frog is “a real frog.” Frog replies in the affirmative and demonstrates his realness by tilting back his head and letting out a wall-rattling series of ribits. Frog tells Katagiri that there will be an earthquake three days from now, much bigger than the one that struck Kobe a month earlier. More than 150,000 people will die, and the city’s infrastructure will be destroyed. The epicenter will be right under Katagiri’s bank office. Frog tells Katagiri that to stop the earthquake from happening, the two of them must go underground and do mortal combat with Worm."
Super-Frog Saves TokyoHaruki Murakami,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/super-frog-saves-tokyo/summary.html,"Frog explains that Worm is a giant worm that has slept deep beneath Tokyo for decades, his eyes and brain slowly atrophying. Worm absorbs reverberations as he sleeps and replaces those impulses with rage through a mysterious chemical process. When the rage builds to a certain level, he releases it in the form of an earthquake. Frog says that he feels no personal animosity toward Worm but that Worm has nevertheless become too dangerous to ignore. Katagiri accepts this explanation, but he still doesn’t understand why Frog has chosen him for the mission."
Super-Frog Saves TokyoHaruki Murakami,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/super-frog-saves-tokyo/summary.html,"Frog says that he’s been watching Katagiri for a long time. He’s seen Katagiri do the dirty, difficult work of collecting money from thugs without ever receiving the recognition he deserves. He’s also seen the sacrifices Katagiri made for his siblings. Frog says there is no one in Tokyo he would rather have by his side in this battle. Katagiri suggests that Frog will be better off with someone who’s stronger, maybe a martial arts expert. Frog waves him off, saying that he’ll do the fighting but needs Katagiri for moral support. Frog is also frightened and reluctant to fight Worm, but he quotes Nietzsche’s maxim that “the highest wisdom is to have no fear.”"
Super-Frog Saves TokyoHaruki Murakami,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/super-frog-saves-tokyo/summary.html,"As a final reassurance, Frog offers to solve a sticky loan situation for Katagiri involving a company called Big Bear Trading. Then Frog flattens himself up and slips out through the door crack. The next morning, a lawyer calls Katagiri to say that that Big Bear will pay off all debts as long as Frog stays away. Frog comes to Katagiri’s office at lunch. He tells Katagiri not to worry because no one else can see him. Now that he’s proven his existence, Frog wants confirmation that Katagiri will help him fight Worm. There will be no glory in their battle, he warns, because no one besides the two of them will ever know it has taken place. Katagiri tries to convince Frog once again that he’s not worthy, but Frog says that people like Katagiri are the reason why Tokyo is worth saving and that only someone like Katagiri could help him win the battle. Katagiri reluctantly agrees."

He assures Katagiri that he has battle plans but refuses to divulge them when Katagiri asks for details. Katagiri pushes again, asking what Frog will do if Katagiri gets scared and runs away. Frog thinks and then answers that he would just have to fight alone, even though he would have about as much hope of defeating Worm alone as Anna Karenina would have had of beating the speeding locomotive that killed her. Frog seems disappointed that Katagiri has not read Tolstoy’s novel."
Super-Frog Saves TokyoHaruki Murakami,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/super-frog-saves-tokyo/summary.html,"Frog appears in Katagiri’s hospital room that night, exhausted and wounded. Katagiri begins to apologize for not meeting him in the boiler room, but Frog explains that Katagiri did help him—in his dreams. The battle took place in the area of imagination, Frog explains. He describes how Katagiri brought in a foot-powered generator to light Frog’s way in the battle to fight off the encroaching darkness. In the end, Frog was unable to defeat Worm, able only to call a draw and prevent the earthquake from taking place."
Super-Frog Saves TokyoHaruki Murakami,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/super-frog-saves-tokyo/summary.html,"On the evening of the battle, however, Katagiri is shot while returning from his collection rounds.

Katagiri wakes up in a hospital, where the attending nurse explains that it’s 9:15 a.m., February 18. Katagiri asks about the previous night’s earthquake and is relieved to discover that nothing happened. He’s perplexed, however, to learn that he wasn’t shot. He was found lying unconscious on the street and had apparently been yelling Frog’s name in the hospital all night long."
Super-Frog Saves TokyoHaruki Murakami,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/super-frog-saves-tokyo/summary.html,"Frog then slips into a coma. He begins to twitch, and boils break out all over his body. The boils pop, and creatures that look like worms, maggots, and centipedes start crawling out. Frog’s eyeballs fall to the floor, where they’re eaten by bugs. The entire room is covered with insects, blotting out the light, overwhelming Katagiri in his bed. He screams. The nurse turns on the light, and the bugs are suddenly gone. She gives Katagiri an injection and tells him that he had another nightmare. Delirious, Katagiri tells the nurse that Frog sacrificed himself to save Tokyo from an earthquake. The nurse says that Katagiri must have been very fond of Frog. “Locomotive,” he says. “More than anybody.” She wipes the sweat from his brow as he drifts into a deep sleep."

Inspired by the ""gusts of memory"" that rise up within him as he dips a Madeleine into hot tea, the narrator discusses his fear of going to bed at night. He is a creature of habit and dislikes waking up in the middle of the night not knowing where he is. He claims that people are defined by the objects that surround them and must piece together their identities bit by bit each time they wake up.

The Verdurins grow suspicious and jealous of Swann's famous friends, including the Prince of Wales, and begin to push him out of their social circle. Odette begins to cheat on Swann with Forcheville, another of the Verdurins' guests; Swann discovers this infidelity by reading one of Odette's letters to Forcheville. One of Swann's closest friends, Charlus, tries to turn Odette back toward Swann but ends up sending him an anonymous letter about Odette's history of infidelity. Swann finally confronts her and learns the truth about her torrid sexual escapades. Dumbfounded, Swann retreats back into the high society of aristocrats and royalty that he had enjoyed before meeting Odette. His suffering soon diminishes, and he gets used to seeing her only rarely.

He finds her only vaguely attractive, however, until one day when he realizes that she resembles Botticelli's beautiful rendering of Jethro's daughter in his painting Zipporrah. Idealizing Odette through the intermediary of the painting, Swann respects her beauty with all his heart and starts to obsess about her day and night. Odette introduces Swann to the Verdurins and their nightly salon. At first, they love Swann's company and make him one of their ""faithful"" guests. One night, after failing to see Odette at the Verdurins, Swann looks for her all over Paris. When they finally run into each other, their passion ignites and they become lovers.

The BacchaeEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/bacchae/summary.html,"Pentheus is left intrigued and excited by the messenger's marvelous and frightening tale. Dionysus takes note of Pentheus's interest and offers him a chance to see the maenads for himself, undetected. Pentheus, on the verge of launching a military expedition to arrest the band, suddenly cannot resist the opportunity to see the forbidden. He agrees to do all Dionysus suggests, dressing himself in a wig and long skirts. The effeminate Pentheus, stripped of his masculinity and authority, is revealed as a vain, boastful and lecherous creature. Once in the woods, Pentheus cannot see the bacchants from the ground, and wants to mount a tree for a better vantage. Dionysus miraculously bends a tall fir tree, puts Pentheus on top, and gently straightens the tree. At once the maenads see him, and Dionysus orders them to attack the vulnerable ruler. With rolling eyes and frenzied cries the women attack, bringing Pentheus down and dragging him to the ground. As he falls Pentheus reaches out for his mother's face and pleads with her to recognize her son. But Agaue, driven mad by Dionysus, proceeds to rip her son to death."
The BacchaeEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/bacchae/summary.html,"At the palace the chorus is exultant and sings the praise of Dionysus. Agaue returns home with Pentheus's head in her hands. She is still deluded and boasts to all about the young lion she hunted and beheaded. Old Cadmus, who knows what has happened, sadly approaches his daughter and draws her mind back to the palace, her family and finally what she is holding in her hands. Agaue begins to weep. Cadmus remarks that the god has punished the family rightly but excessively. In the end, Dionysus finally appears in his true form to the city. He banishes Agaue from Thebes and ordains that Cadmus and his wife will turn into snakes, destined to invade Greek lands with a horde of barbarians."
The BacchaeEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/bacchae/summary.html,"In their second exchange, Dionysus tries to persuade Pentheus to abandon his destructive path, but Pentheus does not relent. A cowherd arrives and describes his sighting of the maddened women of Cadmus. All the women were seen resting blissfully in the forest, feasting on milk, honey and wine that sprang from the ground. They played music, suckled wild animals and sang and danced with joy. But when they saw the cowherd, they flew into a murderous rage and chased after him. The cowherd barely escaped, but the herd of cattle was captured and torn apart by hand by the maenads, including Pentheus's mother Agaue."
The BacchaeEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/bacchae/summary.html,"As the ruler of the state and preserver of social order, Pentheus finds himself threatened by the Dionysian rites bringing the women from the city into the forest. Unconvinced of their divinely-caused insanity, he sees their drunken cavorting as an illicit attempt to escape the mores and legal codes regulating Theban society. His response is therefore a political one, as he orders his soldiers to arrest the Lydian stranger and his maenads, whom he sees as the root of the troubles. Deviously, Dionysus allows himself to be easily arrested and taken to Pentheus with the others. In the first of three encounters, Dionysus begins the long process of trapping Pentheus and leading him to his death. The encounter begins with the powerful Pentheus thinking he has caught the delicate stranger. He orders his androgynous prisoner to be chained, bound, and tortured but soon finds it impossible to do so. When Pentheus tries to tie Dionysus he ties only a bull, when Pentheus plunges a knife into Dionysus the blade passes only through shadow. Suddenly an earthquake shakes the palace, a fire starts, and Pentheus is left weak and puzzled."
The BacchaeEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/bacchae/summary.html,"The action of the play begins with Dionysus's return to Thebes years later. He arrives in town disguised as the stranger, accompanied by a band of bacchants, to punish the family for their treatment of his mother and their refusal to offer him sacrifices. During Dionysus's absence, Semele's father, Cadmus, had handed the kingdom over to his proud grandson Pentheus. It was Pentheus's decision to not allow the worship of Dionysus in Thebes. Dionysus tells the audience that when he arrived in Thebes he drove Semele's sisters mad, and they fled to Mt. Cithaeron to worship him and perform his rites on the mountainside."
The BacchaeEuripides,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/bacchae/summary.html,"Dionysus, the god of wine, prophecy, religious ecstasy, and fertility, returns to his birthplace in Thebes in order to clear his mother's name and to punish the insolent city state for refusing to allow people to worship him. The background to his return is presented in the prologue, in which Dionysus tells the story of his mother, Semele, once a princess in the royal Theban house of Cadmus. She had an affair with Zeus, the king of the gods, and became pregnant. As revenge, Zeus's jealous wife Hera tricked Semele into asking Zeus to appear in his divine form. Zeus, too powerful for a mortal to behold, emerged from the sky as a bolt of lightning and burnt Semele to a cinder. He managed, however, to rescue his unborn son Dionysus and stitched the baby into his thigh. Semele's family claimed that she had been struck by lightning for lying about Zeus and that her child, the product of an illicit human affair, had died with her, maligning her name and rejecting the young god Dionysus."

The Birthmark,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/the-birthmark/summary.html,"Aylmer obsesses about the birthmark. For him, it symbolizes mortality and sin and comes to tower over Georgiana’s beauty in his mind. He can think of nothing else. One night she reminds him of a dream he had. He spoke in his sleep, saying they must take out her heart. Aylmer remembers dreaming that he had removed the birthmark with a knife, plunging down until he had reached his wife’s heart, which he decided to cut out. Georgiana says that she will risk her life to have the birthmark erased. Thrilled, Aylmer agrees to try. He professes complete confidence in his own abilities, likening himself to Pygmalion. He kisses his wife’s unmarked cheek."

Bradley cannot find her anywhere. Christian wants to start a relationship with Bradley, but he declines. Rachel tells Bradley that Julian left him freely because she learned of Bradley's recent sexual encounter with Rachel (Rachel had described the encounter in a letter that Arnold delivered). Bradley is so angry at Rachel's interference that he spitefully shows her a letter that Arnold wrote describing Arnold's love for Christian. Rachel is furious and vows never to forgive Bradley. A few days later, Bradley receives a letter from Julian. Despite her saying otherwise, he decides that she still loves him and that she is in Venice. He makes plans to go there.

several saints. Margery’s devotion to Christ is particularly intense and is
expressed in highly physical, even sexual, terms. In her visions, Margery often sees
herself as a servant to Mary or Jesus, acting as an eyewitness to the events of the
gospels. Jesus speaks to Margery in her visions of such subjects as the Trinity, the
salvation and damnation of souls, and the meaning of the constant tears he sends
her. Margery tries to spend as much time as she can in prayer or in conversation
with her spiritual guides. Even so, her dramatic weeping in church and elsewhere
continues to draw attention and, often, censure. Margery comes into particular
conflict with a friar who moves to Lynn and refuses to allow Margery to hear him
preach because of her disruptive weeping."

a journey to Jerusalem, with a long stopover in Rome. During the pilgrimage, Margery
is shunned by her fellow travelers but is often accepted by the poor, a pattern that
repeats itself throughout her life. In Jerusalem, Margery has several intense
visions, and she begins to have spells in which she sobs and cries uncontrollably.
These crying fits come upon her most often during religious services, but they also
occur whenever she simply thinks of Jesus or sees something that reminds her of his
suffering. Margery is stranded in Rome for a time after giving away her money to the
poor, and she makes her way by begging. Margery’s extreme behavior begins to make
her notorious, and she makes enemies among the English contingent in Rome.

fact that she cannot become a nun. Margery travels to various churches and holy
sites in England, attracting attention wherever she goes, thanks to her public
weeping and her all-white wardrobe. At times, Margery is accepted as a holy woman,
and her advice and blessings are solicited. More often, she is treated as an oddity

mockery. Traveling through the north of England, Margery is arrested several times

volume someone has given her. Shocked by the author’s harsh and extreme portrayal of
the immoral and inconstant nature of women, Christine is saddened by this state of
affairs. A flash of light startles her, and three women, allegorical figures
representing Reason, Rectitude, and Justice, appear to her. They tell her she is to
build the City of Ladies and populate it with the noblest and most accomplished
women the world has known. The city is to serve as a safeguard against the cruel
accusations of men as well as a reminder of the true and laudable nature of women."
The Book of the City of LadiesChristine de Pizan,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cityladies/summary.html,"Lady Reason takes Christine to the Field of Letters, a fertile plain where the
city is to be built, and encourages her to use her pen to start excavating the earth
so they can lay the foundations that will support the City of Ladies. Reason
narrates the lives of various women and the testament of their strength collectively
helps to build the city’s firm support. Reason first tells of women who have
distinguished themselves in the political and military realms, individuals who have
judiciously ruled vast realms as well as defended those realms from insurgents and
attacks from beyond their borders. Next, she discusses learned women, like
Christine, who have developed their intellectual capacities. Collectively, these
women of letters have helped shape Western history and culture. Finally, Reason
relates tales that demonstrate the prudence that women possess. Having completed the
foundation and the walls, Reason turns over the city’s completion to her two
sisters."

Through her tales of holy women, she completes the roofs and adds doorways and gates
to the City of Ladies. Most importantly, she brings the Virgin Mary to the city to
serve as its guide and queen. Justice tells of various women who have been martyred
for their faith. Faced with worshiping false idols and renouncing their love of
Jesus Christ, they never wavered in their love of the one god. Though their physical
bodies were abused, tortured, and violated, their intangible, spiritual selves
remained intact, unsullied, and as strong as ever. Most of these women would go on
to be declared saints. They wished to remain virginal and pure and went to their
deaths in defense of their principles. Some even witnessed the torture and deaths of
their children before succumbing themselves. Justice tells of several women who
lived disguised as men in monasteries so they could remain free of the undesired
attentions of suitors and pursue their religious devotion unhindered."

declares the City of Ladies a refuge where they can find respite and safety from the
sexual aggression and cruel attacks by men. She reminds the inhabitants of this
community of women to stay strong and true and to uphold the noble virtues that have
made the construction of the city possible. The city serves as a testament to the

her words, to complete and enclose the palaces, mansions, and domiciles that will
house the city’s residents. Rectitude begins by telling of ladies of vision and
prophecy who, despite the fact that few heeded their predictions, accurately foresaw
the shape of the future. Rectitude then focuses on the family unit, relaying tales
of faithful daughters and pious wives whose dedication to and love of their
relatives superseded all. Rectitude celebrates all the good and countless benefits
women have brought to the world and argues that they should be given the same access
to education that is extended to men. She then tackles the importance of chastity to
women and the horror and repulsion of rape, which is often insidiously characterized
as something that is actively sought by women or which affects them little. Men, she
claims, are the fickle ones when compared to the steadfastness of most women,
especially those in love. Rectitude concludes her narration with the assertion that
it is integrity, honesty, and generosity that earn a woman distinction, and not her
physical attractiveness. Having completed the city’s edifices and populated it with
noble ladies, Rectitude turns the project over to her sister, Justice, for
completion."

Willie meets his roommates, Roland Keefer, a chubby, lazy, dedicated man from a military prep school, and Edwin Keggs, a high school algebra teacher. The three of them will live in Furnald Hall. Many hijinks ensue, but all three men make the cut and earn positions as officers in the Navy. Willie is almost kicked out on demerits he gets because of his relationship with a lounge singer, May Wynn. He likes May a lot, but thinks of her as a fun fling. She is from a lower class Italian family, which makes her unsuitable in Willie's eyes."
The Caine MutinyHerman Wouk,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cainemutiny/summary.html,"When the Caine arrives back in port, proceedings for a court martial begin immediately. Queeg is kept on shore to undergo a lengthy psychological examination, but Maryk is ordered to take the Caine back out to help with some urgent escort duty. On the tour, the Caine is struck by a kamikaze, but Maryk handles the fire fighting and damage control perfectly. When the ship finally arrives back in San Francisco, the court martial proceedings begin in earnest. All of the Navy's legal officers shun assignment to the case, predicting that defending mutineers would ruin their careers. Finally, a Jewish lawyer from New York, Barney Greenwald, takes the case.

The Caine MutinyHerman Wouk,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cainemutiny/summary.html,"A new captain takes command of the ship: Lieutenant Commander Philip Francis Queeg, who surprises the crew of the Caine by arriving unannounced and catching the ship in its disheveled state. Though the Caine is his first command, and he has never served on a four-pipe minesweeper before, Queeg completes the transfer of command in a mere forty-eight hours, without allowing De Vriess to show him how the ship really works. As soon as De Vriess leaves the ship, things begin to change. Queeg begins making new demands of the crew in an attempt to restore it to Navy regulations. Willie takes to the new captain at once. Queeg's first attempt at conning the ship is a complete disaster. He attempts to turn the ship too quickly when backing out of the slip and badly scrapes the side of a neighboring ship. Queeg then forgets to stop the engines and grounds the ship on the other side of the channel. In another symbolic incident, while Queeg is busy reprimanding a sailor for having his shirttail out, he forgets to stop the ship's turn, and accidentally crosses and cuts the towline they had been using to drag targets. These incidents cause Pacific Command to become suspicious of the new captain of the Caine, so they send him to San Francisco for a refitting instead of sending him directly to combat action. Even on this very safe mission, Queeg creates trouble by trying to smuggle liquor to the states. The loss of the booze falls on Willie and he is forced to pay for it before he is allowed to take shore leave."
The Caine MutinyHerman Wouk,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cainemutiny/summary.html,"When the Caine finally makes it to combat action, Captain Queeg's performance reveals further weaknesses in his ability to command. On a routine escort mission, the captain panics upon realizing how close they will have to go to the shore, and speeds ahead of the group that the Caine was supposed to protect. In another incident, a neighboring ship is straddled by gunfire from a shore battery. Though the battery is easily within range, Queeg does not fire a shot, but instead steams off as fast as the Caine's engines allow. When the ship patrols enemy waters, Queeg always stands on the side of the ship farthest from the shore, which adds to the crew's suspicions of cowardice in their captain. On top of this, the captain piles ridiculous punishments on the crew in response to menial offenses, ordering water famines, denial of liberties, and deprivation of sleep. The executive officer, a peacetime fisherman named Steve Maryk begins a secret log of the captain's questionable activities."
The Caine MutinyHerman Wouk,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cainemutiny/summary.html,"All of the accused are free to continue their military careers. The crew of the Caine is mostly split up to reduce the chance of another incident. Maryk is given an insulting command of a lowly transport craft, and Queeg is assigned to a supply depot in Iowa. Keefer remains on the Caine and becomes captain. Willie is elevated to the position of executive officer. To the surprise of the crew, Keefer becomes just like Queeg, hiding from the crew most of the time and leaving his cabin only to scold and punish people for trivial offenses. His first test as captain arises when a kamikaze crashes into the mid- ship area of the Caine and causes massive damage. Keefer abandons ship, diving into the Pacific with the manuscript of his novel clutched under his good arm. Willie remains onboard, and with the help of some other brave sailors, eventually manages to put out the fire and get the ship underway again. They pick up the sailors who jumped, including Keefer, who swears that Willie will get a medal for his bravery."
The Caine MutinyHerman Wouk,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cainemutiny/summary.html,"Greenwald gets Maryk acquitted by using dirty tricks and playing on predictable Navy mentalities. He confuses the two psychologists and gets them to admit that though Queeg is normally well adjusted, he is prone to breakdown in certain extreme circumstances. Greenwald uses Willie's heated testimony to reveal the captain's cowardice, which the distinguished sailors in the jury find embarrassing. Greenwald puts so much stress on Queeg while Queeg testifies that he becomes the panicky paranoid he had been at sea. After the acquittal, the sailors proceed to a party thrown by Keefer with the money he received for the presale of his war novel. Though Keefer had betrayed his friend in the courtroom to protect himself, Keefer is the most jubilant of all he celebrators. Greenwald stumbles in drunk and reprimands the crew for destroying a sacred military trust. He says it was the Queegs of the regular Navy who saved his Jewish grandmother.

Willie interrupts May Wynn at a rehearsal in New York. She has become a big success as a singer and begun dating her bandleader. Willie once again asks May to marry him, and though the book ends with the question unanswered, the two part on good terms, promising to see each other the next day."
The Caine MutinyHerman Wouk,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/cainemutiny/summary.html,"Tensions between captain and crew come to a head when an unexpected hurricane strikes the Caine while it is supporting a fueling convoy for the attack on the Philippines. The ship is unable to maintain its course because of the strength of the wind. Despite this, Queeg ignores Maryk's recommendations to save the ship by ballasting the water tanks, securing the ammunition, and coming into the wind. The captain becomes frozen with fear, clutching the engine telegraph and responding only to insist that they maintain fleet course with their stern into the wind. Finally, the wind takes the ship and swings it broadside to the waves. Maryk states that he is relieving Queeg of command due to his mental sickness on the authority of article 184 of Naval Regulations. Willie, as officer of the deck, is forced to confirm or deny the order, and he sides with Maryk. The exec successfully pilots the ship out of the typhoon and even picks up survivors from a downed destroyer in the process. Queeg asks to reassume command several times, but Maryk sticks to his decision to take responsibility for the ship and crew."

That night, Willie writes her an eight-page letter begging her to forgive him and be his wife. He sends it away and spends the last months of the war eagerly awaiting a reply. The reply never arrives. When the war ends, Keefer is decommissioned and Willie becomes captain of the damaged Caine. Another typhoon strikes, but Willie expertly manipulates the ship's rudder and engines to keep it from dragging anchor. The next day, in a rash move, Willie and his old midshipmen's school buddy Keggs go to fleet command to request permission to take the Caine back to the states for scrapping. The Caine is so badly damaged she could neither perform minesweeping duties nor risk weathering another hurricane. Willie convinces the operations officer to let him take the Caine back to New York so that the Navy will at least get scrap value for the old hulk."

Willie is indoctrinated into the ship's ragtag communications department, which is managed by Lieutenant Tom Keefer, Roland's brother and a budding novelist.

him. Buck becomes the property of Francois and Perrault, two mail

to life as a sled dog. He recovers the instincts of his wild ancestors:
he learns to fight, scavenge for food, and sleep beneath the snow
on winter nights. At the same time, he develops a fierce rivalry
with Spitz, the lead dog in the team. One of their fights is broken

wife into having sex with him by borrowing money from the merchant, then
giving it to the wife so she can repay her own debt to her husband,
in exchange for sexual favors. When the monk sees the merchant next,
he tells him that he returned the merchant’s money to his wife.
The wife realizes she has been duped, but she boldly tells her husband
to forgive her debt: she will repay it in bed. The Host praises

She drags him over to the chairs and he sits down on her lap. She praises his intellect, and said he could have had a powerful occupation, if he had any ambition. He scoffs at this and complains of boredom."

He walks onstage after everyone else has left, quietly muttering about how life has left him by.

The Cherry OrchardAnton Chekhov,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/cherryorchard/summary.html,"Soon, Trofimov appears, and gives several speeches about the importance of work and the laziness and stupidity of Russian intellectuals. In a quiet moment, the sound of a snapping string is heard, and no one can identify its source. A drunkard appears, asking for directions, and then money; Ranevsky ends up giving him several gold pieces. Disturbed, most of the group leave, except for Anya and Trofimov. They discuss Varya's growing suspicion that Anya and Trofimov are having an affair, which they are not; Trofimov declares that they are ""above love"". The act ends with Yephikodov sadly playing his guitar and Varya calling out, in vain, for Anya."

Also accompanying her are Firs, her 87-year old manservant; her elder, yet still infantile, brother Leonid Gayev; and her adopted daughter Varya; these last three have stayed in Russia but went to the station to greet Ranevsky on her return"

Varya reveals that the family's estate is to be sold at auction on the 22nd of August, in order to pay their debts. Anya reveals that Ranevsky's departure for Paris was caused by her grief over two deaths: that of her husband six years before and that of her son, Grisha, who drowned a month thereafter."
The Cherry OrchardAnton Chekhov,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/cherryorchard/summary.html,"The play begins in the pre-dawn hours of a May morning in Russia. We learn that the cherry trees are in bloom even though it is frosty outside. Yermolay Lopakhin, a friend of the family, and Dunyasha a maid on the Ranevsky estate, wait for the estate's owner Ranevsky at the estate's main house, in a room called ""the nursery"". Lopakhin reveals that Ranevsky has been in Paris for the last five years. Lopakhin is a local businessman in his mid- thirties, dressed in a fine white suit (with gaudy yellow shoes), whose feelings towards Ranevsky are mixed between affectionate gratitude for past kindnesses, and resentment at her condescension toward him because of his humble, peasant origins. Also on the estate is Simon Yephikodov, a hapless youth nicknamed ""Simple Simon"" because of his frequent and ridiculous accidents."
The Cherry OrchardAnton Chekhov,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/cherryorchard/summary.html,"Soon, Anya departs for bed, and Lopakhin brings up the issue of the imminent sale. He proposes a solution; Ranevksy should parcel out the land on her estate, build cottages on the parcels, and lease them out to summer cottage-holders, who are becoming increasingly numerous. Gayev and Ranevsky dismiss thr idea, because it would necessitate cutting down the family's beloved (and gigantic) cherry orchard. Before he leaves, Lopakhin offers them a loan of 50,000 rubles to buy their property at auction if they change their minds, and predicts there will be no other way of saving the orchard. Ranevsky then lends some money to a fellow impoverished landowner, Boris Simeonov-Pischik. Peter Trofimov arrives; he was Grisha's tutor before the drowning, and thus he brings back painful memories for Ranevsky. Before the end of the act, after complaining about Ranevksy's inability to curb her spending, Gayev outlines three alternatives to Lopakhin's plan: a financing scheme involving some banker friends of his, Ranevsky borrowing some money from Lopakhin (without the condition that they then cut down the orchard), and a wealthy aunt in Yaroslavl who might provide a loan."
The Cherry OrchardAnton Chekhov,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/cherryorchard/summary.html,"In the Second Act, we are introduced more closely to the young servants on the estate, Dunyasha, Yasha, and Yephikodov, who are involved in a love triangle: Yephikodov loves Dunyasha, Dunyasha loves Yasha, and Yasha is very much in love with himself. Soon, Lopakhin, Ranevsky, Gayev, Anya and Varya appear, and they are again debating over Lopakhin's plan to turn the orchard into cottage country. Lopakhin becomes frustrated with Ranevsky's reluctance; she, in turn, thinks his plan is vulgar, and says that if they plan to sell the cherry orchard, she wants to be sold along with it. Ranevsky reveals that she has a lover in Paris who has been sending her telegrams, asking her to return, and who robbed her, left her, and as a result drove her to a suicide attempt."
The Cherry OrchardAnton Chekhov,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/cherryorchard/summary.html,"In the Third Act, Ranevsky throws a party on the day of the auction. The guests consist of several local bureaucratic officials such as the stationmaster and a post-office clerk. Charlotte entertains the guests with a series of magic tricks. Ranevsky worries anxiously about why Gayev and Lopakhin have not yet returned. Ranevsky fears that the orchard has been lost, that the aunt in Yaroslavl has apparently not given them enough money to buy it, and that Gayev's other sources have failed to come through. She and Trofimov get into an argument; Trofimov accuses her of not being able to face the truth, and she accuses him of being unusual for never having fallen in love. Lopakhin and Gayev soon return from the auction. Lopakhin reveals to everyone that he has bought the estate and intends to carry out his plans for the orchard's destruction. Anya tries, in vain, to comfort her mother."
The Cherry OrchardAnton Chekhov,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/cherryorchard/summary.html,"In the last act, it is October, and the trees in the cherry orchard are already being cut down. All the characters are in the process of leaving; Lopakhin will depart to Kharkov for the winter, Varya to the Ragulins', another family that lives fifty miles away. Gayev plans to live in the town, working at a bank, Anya will go off to school, and Ranevksy will leave for Paris with Yasha, to rejoin her lover. Charlotte has no idea what she will do, but Lopakhin assures her he will help her find something. Trofimov and Lopakhin exchange an affectionate if contentious farewell; Yasha leaves Dunyasha, weeping, without a second thought; and Anya tearfully says goodbye to her mother. Anya worries that Firs, who has taken ill, has not been sent to the hospital as he was supposed to be, but Yasha indignantly assures Anya that he has. Ranevsky encourages Lopakhin to propose to Varya; but the proposal is never made—Lopakhin leaves Varya alone, and in tears. Finally, Gayev and Ranevsky bid a tearful farewell to their house. Everyone leaves, locking the doors behind them."

Early in the book, Jerry's friend known as The Goober gets an assignment from The Vigils. He sneaks into one of the classrooms at night and unscrews desks, chairs and hinges, leaving the screws in by just a thread.

When Leon calls his name during the chocolate roll call, however, Jerry blurts out ""no."" When The Goober asks Jerry why he refused, Jerry does not have an answer.

The raffle is a special one, however, which pits Jerry against school thug Emile Janza. The students who buy raffle tickets get to write on them a boxing move, directing Jerry to hit Janza or vice versa, and where. During the fight, Jerry and Janza are hitting each other as directed. Janza is much stronger, and his punches have much more staying power even though Jerry lands a good hit of his own. Then, a member of The Vigils draws a raffle ticket that tells Janza to hit Jerry in the groin. Jerry blocks the punch, and the warfare begins. Janza decides not to abide by any rules, and punches Jerry over and over. Finally, after Jerry collapses, the lights in the stadium go off. Brother Jacques is there, stopping the ceremony.

Elisa is thirty-five years old, attractive and clear-eyed, although at the moment she is clad in a masculine gardening outfit with men’s shoes and a man’s hat.

The CloudsAristophanes,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/theclouds/summary.html,"Strepsiades runs home and quizzes Pheidippides with his newly acquired sophistry. He drags Pheidippides to the school where the two Arguments, Just and Unjust, argue over the proper model for boys' education. Just suggests a model of education based on traditional poetry and physical fitness, but his descriptions falter when his libido overwhelms him. Unjust unravels Just's argument with examples drawn from myth and other trivia. Just is thoroughly flustered and Unjust is granted Pheidippides as a pupil. The Chorus of Clouds intimates that Strepsiades's forcible education of Pheidippides will be his own undoing before turning to the audience, wheedling, bribing, and even threatening them for their approval of the play."

Strepsiades calls in a Slave to bring him his accounts so that he may tabulate his debts. Looking over his debts, he becomes enraged and his voice wakes Pheidippides. Strepsiades begs Pheidippides to refrain from his expensive ways and begs him to enroll in the new-fangled school next door wherein he may learn about esoteric natural sciences as well as sophistry that might help him outwit their creditors in court. Pheidippides stubbornly refuses, leaving Strepsiades to enroll himself."
The CloudsAristophanes,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/theclouds/summary.html,"Sure enough, as their song winds down, Strepsiades bursts from the house while being beaten by Pheidippides. The two have been quarreling over the recitation of traditional poetry. Pheidippides defends his beatings using sophistry. Strepsiades mourns that he has exchanged Pheidippides's obsession with expensive horses for his obsession with sophistry and rhetoric, which is proving to also have its price. Strepsiades blames the Chorus of Clouds for misleading him and they defend themselves by asserting that their deception taught Strepsiades a lesson. Strepsiades concedes that he has been wrong but still hungers to do violence against Socrates and the school. He summons his slave Xanthias and the two run over to the school and set fire to the roof. Chaerephon and a Second Student cry out from within as the building burns and finally rush outside.

While the Student is showing Strepsiades their maps, Socrates appears in a balloon-basket hanging in mid-air. Socrates explains that the contraption helps him ""suspend"" (I.i.230) his judgment and open his mind to new ideas. Strepsiades explains his plight and asks for guidance.

The Color of WaterJames McBride,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/colorofwater/summary.html,"In The Color of Water, author James McBride writes both his autobiography and a tribute to the life of his mother, Ruth McBride. Ruth came to America when she was a young girl in a family of Polish Jewish immigrants. Ruth married Andrew Dennis McBride, a black man from North Carolina. James's childhood was spent in a chaotic household of twelve children who had neither the time nor the outlet to ponder questions of race and identity. Ruth did not want to discuss the painful details of her early family life, when her abusive father Tateh lorded over her sweet-tempered and meek mother Mameh. Ruth had cut all ties with her Jewish family."
The Color of WaterJames McBride,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/colorofwater/summary.html,"James's confusion over his identity, along with his grief for the death of his beloved stepfather, drove him to a phase of drug use and crime. After spending time with working with black men in Louisville, Kentucky, where his sister Jack lives, James became convinced of the importance of self-reliance and hard work. He began to trust in God and to work toward self-improvement, honing his skills in jazz music and writing. During his senior year of high school, James was pleasantly surprised when he learned he had been admitted to Oberlin College. He and his eleven siblings complete college and lead successful careers. Ruth remains close with her children, and, later, her grandchildren, holding holiday gatherings that remind James of his household during childhood: chaotic, but delightfully active and stimulating."
The Color of WaterJames McBride,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/colorofwater/summary.html,"After arriving in the United States when she was two years old, Ruth spent her early childhood traveling around the country with her family as her father sought employment as a rabbi. Tateh eventually gave up hope of making a living as a rabbi. He settled the family in Suffolk, Virginia, and opened a store in the mostly black section of town, where he overcharged his customers and expressed racist opinions. When Ruth was a child, Tateh sexually abused her and made harsh demands on her to work constantly in the family store. Tateh cheated on his wife, in an affair of which practically everyone in town was aware. Ruth's brother Sam left home at age fifteen, and soon after, Ruth too felt she must leave. She wanted to escape the oppressive environment of both her family and the South. She was also pregnant by Peter, her black boyfriend in Suffolk, and wanted to deal with the pregnancy away from her family. She took trips to New York to stay with relatives, and later moved permanently to Harlem. Ruth's family disowned her when she left, disgusted with her preference for marrying a black man instead of a Jewish man, her general failure to embrace Judaism, and her defiance of her father. Ruth promised her sister Dee-Dee that she would return to Suffolk, but she could not reconcile her family's desires for her life with her own desires for her life. She betrayed her promise to return for Dee-Dee, and her relationship with her sister suffered as a consequence. This separation from her family recurs throughout the memoir as a painful element in Ruth's life."
The Color of WaterJames McBride,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/colorofwater/summary.html,"In Harlem, Ruth met Dennis, to whom she was immediately attracted. She married him, converted to Christianity, and became very involved with church activities. The couple experienced a certain degree of prejudice as a result of their interracial marriage. However, Ruth recalls these years of her life as her happiest ones. Dennis and Ruth opened the New Brown Memorial Church together in memory of Reverend Brown, their favorite preacher. They had several children, and eventually moved to accommodate their growing family. When Ruth became pregnant with Dennis's eighth child, James, Dennis fell ill with lung cancer, and died before James was born. Ruth mourned his death deeply and became desperate to find a means to support herself and her eight children. She approached her relatives for assistance, but they refused to have any sort of contact with her. Ruth met her second husband, Hunter Jordan, soon after. They married and eventually had four children together."
The Color of WaterJames McBride,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/colorofwater/summary.html,"James weaves his own life story into his mother's story. Ruth's philosophies on race, religion, and work influence him greatly. Ruth always sent her children to the best schools, no matter the commute, to ensure they received the finest possible educations. She demanded respect and hard work from her children, and always treated them tenderly. She had an unwavering faith in God and strong moral convictions. To Ruth, issues of race and identity took secondary importance to moral beliefs."

Oedipa begins to give up as she realizes that she is very lonely and has no real friends. She visits Mike Fallopian again, who suggests that the whole Tristero mystery may be nothing more than a huge, complex joke played on her by Pierce. Oedipa will not accept this possibility but realizes that every route leading to the Tristero also leads to the Inverarity Estate. Meanwhile, Genghis Cohen helps her piece together some mysteries about Pierce's stamp collection, which is to be auctioned off by a local dealer as Lot 49. Genghis has heard that a secretive bidder will attend the auction to bid on Lot 49, but he will not reveal himself beforehand. Oedipa goes to the auction, excited to find out who the bidder is, thinking that he may know the key to the Tristero.

The Death of Ivan IlychLeo Tolstoy,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/ivanilych/summary.html,"Ivan begins to experience some discomfort in his left side and an unusual taste in his mouth. The discomfort gradually increases and soon Ivan is both irritable and quarrelsome. The doctors Ivan visits all disagree on the nature of the illness, and Ivan becomes depressed and fearful. Even cards lose their appeal. Ivan's physical condition degenerates rapidly. One night while lying alone in the dark, he is visited by his first thoughts of mortality, and they terrify him. He realizes that his illness is not a question of health or disease, but of life or death. Praskovya does not understand nor wish to understand her husband's plight, and Ivan can barely suppress his hatred for her. Ivan knows that he is dying, but he is unable to grasp the full implications of his mortality. He tries to erect screens to block the thought of death from his mind, but death haunts him ceaselessly. In the midst of this suffering, Gerasim, Ivan's peasant servant, enters the scene. Assigned the task of helping Ivan with his excretions, Gerasim soon begins passing the entire night with the dying man. To ease his pain, Gerasim supports Ivan's legs on his shoulders. More than any other living person, Gerasim provides Ivan with the compassion and honesty that he needs. Ivan's daily routine is monotonous and maddening. As those around him continue to pretend that he is only sick and not dying, Ivan feels that he is surrounded by artificiality. No one wants to confront the fact of Ivan's imminent death. Ivan becomes silently enraged, and seeing his little son Vasya, Ivan realizes that Vasya is the only one besides Gerasim who understands him. That night Ivan dreams of a deep black sack. He is being violently pushed into the sack, but cannot fall through. And he both fears and desires to fall into it. Awaking from his dream, Ivan sends Gerasim away, and for the first time he hears the inner voice of his soul speaking to him. Twelve more days pass, and Ivan is no longer able to leave the sofa. He lies pondering death and questioning the rationale behind his suffering. As he examines his life, Ivan realizes that the further back he looks, the more joy there is. He finds that just as the pain grew worse and worse, so too did his life. He knows that an explanation for the suffering would be possible if he had not lived rightly, but recalling the propriety of his life, he resigns himself to the senselessness of death. Then, one night while looking at Gerasim's face, Ivan begins to doubt whether he has lived his life correctly. He imagines the black sack again, and the immense agony he experiences stems partly from his being thrust into the sack, and partly from not being able to get right into it. The conviction that his life was a good one prevents him from entering the sack, but for some reason he is unwilling to relinquish that belief. Suddenly, ""some force"" strikes Ivan in the chest and side. It pushes him through the sack and into the presence of a bright light. At that very moment his hand falls on his sons head and he feels sorry for him. His wife approaches his bed, her face wet with tears, and he feels sorry for her too. He realizes that his official life and his family and social relations were all artificial. And he experiences a sense of extreme joy. In the middle of a sigh, Ivan stretches out and dies."

Ivan is the second of three sons, and in all respects is an average and commonplace person. Around the age of thirteen he attends the School of Law where he assimilates the values and behavior of those with high social standing. Ivan becomes an examining magistrate in the reformed judicial institutions and moves to a new province. Ivan marries and things progress smoothly until Praskovya becomes pregnant. As Praskovya's behavior begins to disrupt the proper and decorous lifestyle cherished by Ivan and approved by society, Ivan increasingly absorbs himself in his official work and distances himself from his family. At work he prides himself on removing all personal concerns from his consideration, and at home he adopts a formal attitude toward his family. Time passes and Ivan moves up in the ranks. He expects to be awarded the post of presiding judge in a University town, but is passed over for promotion. Infuriated and struck by a keen sense of injustice, Ivan obtains a leave of absence and moves with his family to his brother-in-law's house in the country. Conscious that his salary cannot cover his family's living expenses, Ivan travels to St. Petersburg to look for a higher paying job. He learns that due to a change in the administration of the Ministry of Justice, a close friend has landed a position of great authority. Ivan is awarded a higher paying position in the city, and informing his family of the good news, Ivan departs alone to buy and furnish a house in preparation for the family's arrival. One day as he is mounting a step-ladder to hang some drapes, he makes a false step and slips, banging his side against the window frame. The injury is not serious, however, and Ivan is quite pleased with the final appearance of the house. He settles into his new life and acquires a love of bridge."

The Elegant UniverseBrian Greene,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/elegantuniverse/summary.html,"Without dismissing the importance of electrons and quarks, which
are the basis of quantum mechanics, superstring theory depicts the
smallest particles in the universe not as dots but as tiny strings
of energy. These strings are one hundred billion billion (a quintillion)
times smaller than a single atomic nucleus. They vibrate in different
patterns, which in turn produce different particle properties. But
because these strings are too tiny to locate with current scientific
tools, superstring theory is not yet predictable or testable. Therefore,
physicists like Greene must work with approximations of equations
until more information has been verified. Still, the promise of
string theory is tremendous. Only string theory’s conceptual framework
offers any possibility of unifying general relativity and quantum
mechanics into one complete understanding of how the universe works."
The Elegant UniverseBrian Greene,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/elegantuniverse/summary.html,"In Part I of The Elegant Universe, “The
Edge of Knowledge,” Greene introduces the central problem of modern
physics: the incompatibility of Einstein’s theory of general relativity
with quantum mechanics. He then lists the physical curiosities—properties
of the motion of light, gravity, and the behavior of particles at
the subatomic level—that have prevented physicists from establishing
a single coherent theory for how the universe works. For most of
the twentieth century, physicists contented themselves with describing either
the most small-scale or the most large-scale workings of the cosmos,
but never both simultaneously. At the end of this section, Greene
describes both the objectives and the promise of superstring theory,
which attempts to merge the laws of general relativity with those
of quantum mechanics."
The Elegant UniverseBrian Greene,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/elegantuniverse/summary.html,"Part V, “Unification in the Twenty-First Century,” concludes
the book. It covers the prospects of string theory in the twenty-first
century. It describes the advances Greene and other string theorists hope
to make in unveiling a single theory to explain the entire universe.
For all his optimistic predictions, however, Greene never hesitates
to admit that because of its complexity, superstring theory might
not be fully understood for many years."
The Elegant UniverseBrian Greene,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/elegantuniverse/summary.html,"In Part III, “The Cosmic Symphony,” Greene discusses in
detail how superstring theory works. He employs many musical metaphors
to suggest how strings “harmonize” or bring together the most puzzling
aspects of the cosmos. After praising the elegance and economy of
the theory, Greene gives a brief history of its first incarnation
in the 1970s, when it was referred to as the bosonic string theory.
He also explains the subsequent revisions the theory underwent during
the first superstring revolution in 1984. Greene then describes
how supersymmetry— a concept that predicts the existence of superpartners
that correspond with all known particles—transformed string theory
into superstring theory."
The Elegant UniverseBrian Greene,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/elegantuniverse/summary.html,"Part IV, “String Theory and the Fabric of Spacetime,”
is the most complicated and involved section of the book. Greene
begins with an overview of quantum geometry and the new kind of
math that must emerge to explain the universe on an ultramicroscopic
scale. He argues that contrary to what physicists previously believed,
the fabric of space can be ripped and torn with
no catastrophic consequences. He also covers the second superstring
revolution, which shows that all five string theories are really
part of a single, unified framework called M-theory. It is fitting
that no one knows what the “M” signifies, because M-theory is one
of the most radical, incompletely understood theories ever to evolve.
M-theory proposes the unification of gravity with the three nongravitational
forces. It is an extension of string theory that suggests the elementary
particles of the universe might include, in addition to strings,
two-dimensional membranes and three-dimensional blobs of varying
size. Greene ends his discussion of the latest advances in superstring
theory by discussing its cosmological implications, what it might
reveal about the origins of the universe."
The Elegant UniverseBrian Greene,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/elegantuniverse/summary.html,"In 2004, Brian Greene published a simplified follow-up
to The Elegant Universe called The Fabric
of the Cosmos. He claims to have written The Fabric
of the Cosmos because his mother—to whom The Elegant
Universe is dedicated—told him that she put down the book
and never finished it. She said it was too difficult for the average
person to understand. The Fabric of the Cosmos is
the best first resource for someone having trouble with The
Elegant Universe. It is written in the same engaging, user-friendly
language, but the technical explanations are considerably easier
to understand. Chapter 12 of The Fabric of the Cosmos,
“The World on a String,” succinctly summarizes the history of string
theory, while Chapter 13, “The Universe on a Brane,” introduces
the findings of the second superstring revolution."
The Elegant UniverseBrian Greene,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/elegantuniverse/summary.html,"With these basics covered, Greene proceeds to one of the
oddest claims of string theory: the theory that the universe contains
far more dimensions than we can perceive. In its current form, superstring
theory postulates the existence of eleven total
dimensions: ten of space and one of time. According to the theory,
equations of quantum theory can mesh beautifully with relativity
if we assume the existence of eleven dimensions. Greene concludes
“The Cosmic Symphony” by analyzing the central difficulty of string
theory—namely, the lack of experimental evidence for superstring
theory. He describes the efforts he and his colleagues have made
to develop string theory and refine its underlying mathematical
principles. He shows what a Calabi-Yau space (the six-dimensional
shape that physicists believe the additional, curled-up dimensions
of space will form) may look like."
The Elegant UniverseBrian Greene,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/elegantuniverse/summary.html,"In Part II, “The Dilemma of Space, Time, and the Quanta,” Greene
reviews the basic precepts of the two competing theories—first,
Einstein’s special and general relativity, and then the “microscopic
weirdness” of quantum mechanics. General relativity presupposes
a smooth surface of space, but at an ultramicroscopic level (which
quantum mechanics has helped unveil), the spatial fabric is subject
to violent undulations known as “quantum foam.” Greene also discusses
the basic principle of quantum mechanics: the uncertainty principle.
The uncertainty principle predicts the impossibility of knowing
both the exact location and the velocity of a particle at any given
time. Greene goes over the four fundamental forces—the strong force,
the weak force, electromagnetism, and gravity—and he describes the
complexity of incorporating gravity into the standard model of the
first three. In the last chapter of this section, Greene stresses
the necessity of finding a new theory that revises both general
relativity and quantum mechanics. Like many of his colleagues, Greene
simply cannot accept that the universe is, at its core, divided
into two contradictory theoretical frameworks."

He does not know who they were, but he feels grateful to them nonetheless. To pass the time, Hana reads to the English patient—she assumes he is English by his manner and speech—and also gardens, fixes up the villa, and plays hopscotch. Sometimes she picks up the patient's notebook, a copy of Herodotus's The Histories marked throughout with his own notes, figures, and observations, and reads to him or to herself."

His real name is Almasy, though this is not definitively confirmed until Chapter IX. He spent the years from 1930 to the start of World War II exploring the North African desert. His job was to make observations, draw maps, and search for ancient oases in the sands. Along with his fellow European counterparts, Almasy knew every inch of the desert and made many trips across it. In 1936, a young man from Oxford, Geoffrey Clifton, and his new wife Katharine, joined their party. Geoffrey owned a plane, which the party found especially useful in helping to map the desert. The explorers, Almasy, and the Cliftons got along very well. One night, after hearing Katharine read a passage from his book of Herodotus, Almasy realized he was in love with her. They soon began a torrid and tumultuous affair. Everywhere they stole glances and moments, and they were obsessed with each other. Finally, in 1938, Katharine broke off their affair, telling Almasy that Geoffrey would go mad if he ever found out. Although their affair was over, Almasy remained haunted by her, and he tried to punish her for hurting him by being particularly mean to her in public. At some point, Geoffrey somehow found out about the affair."

Roark admires. Roark’s schoolmate, Peter Keating, moves to New York
and goes to work for the prestigious architectural firm Francon
& Heyer, run by the famous Guy Francon. Roark and Cameron create
beautiful work, but their projects rarely receive recognition,
whereas Keating’s ability to flatter and please brings him almost
instant success. In just a few years, he becomes a partner at the
firm after he causes Francon’s previous partner to have a stroke.
Henry Cameron retires, financially ruined, and Roark opens his own
small office. His unwillingness to compromise his designs in order
to satisfy clients eventually forces him to close down the office
and take a job at a granite quarry in Connecticut."

attraction to Dominique Francon, Guy Francon’s temperamental and
beautiful daughter. Society disgusts Dominique, and she has retreated
to her family’s estate to escape the mediocre architecture she sees
all around her. One night, Roark enters the house and rapes her.
Dominique discovers that this is what she had needed, but when she
looks for Roark, he has left the quarry to design a building for
a prominent New York businessman. Dominique returns to New York
and discovers Roark’s identity. She realizes that he designed a
building she admires. Dominique and Roark begin to meet in secret,
but in public she tries to sabotage his career and destroy him.
Ellsworth Toohey, an architectural critic and socialist, slowly
prepares to rise to power. He seeks to prevent men from excelling
by teaching that talent and ability are of no great consequence,
and that the greatest virtue is humility. Toohey sees Roark as a
great threat and tries to destroy him. Toohey convinces a weak-minded
businessman named Hopton Stoddard to hire Roark as the designer
for a temple dedicated to the human spirit, then persuades the businessman
to sue Roark once the building is completed. At Roark’s trial, every
prominent architect in New York testifies that Roark’s style is
unorthodox and illegitimate, but Dominique declares that the world
does not deserve the gift Roark has given it. Stoddard wins the
case and Roark loses his business again. To punish herself for desiring
Roark, Dominique marries Peter Keating."

orders his newspapers to defend him. The Banner’s circulation
drops and the workers go on strike, but Wynand keeps printing with

At the trial, Roark seems doomed, but he rouses the courtroom with
a statement about the value of selfishness and the need to remain
true to oneself. Roark describes the triumphant role of creators

The GiverLois Lowry,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/giver/summary.html,"The Giver transmits memories by placing his hands on Jonas’s bare
back. The first memory he receives is of an exhilarating sled ride.
As Jonas receives memories from the Giver—memories of pleasure and
pain, of bright colors and extreme cold and warm sun, of excitement
and terror and hunger and love—he realizes how bland and empty life
in his community really is. The memories make Jonas’s life richer
and more meaningful, and he wishes that he could give that richness
and meaning to the people he loves. But in exchange for their peaceful
existence, the people of Jonas’s community have lost the capacity
to love him back or to feel deep passion about anything. Since they
have never experienced real suffering, they also cannot appreciate
the real joy of life, and the life of individual people seems less
precious to them. In addition, no one in Jonas’s community has ever
made a choice of his or her own. Jonas grows more and more frustrated
with the members of his community, and the Giver, who has felt the
same way for many years, encourages him. The two grow very close,
like a grandfather and a grandchild might have in the days before
Sameness, when family members stayed in contact long after their
children were grown."
The GiverLois Lowry,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/giver/summary.html,"At the Ceremony of Twelve, Jonas is given the highly honored Assignment
of Receiver of Memory. The Receiver is the sole keeper of the community’s
collective memory. When the community went over to Sameness—its
painless, warless, and mostly emotionless state of tranquility and
harmony—it abandoned all memories of pain, war, and emotion, but
the memories cannot disappear totally. Someone must keep them so
that the community can avoid making the mistakes of the past, even
though no one but the Receiver can bear the pain. Jonas receives
the memories of the past, good and bad, from the current Receiver,
a wise old man who tells Jonas to call him the Giver."
The GiverLois Lowry,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/giver/summary.html,"Meanwhile, Jonas is helping his family take care of a
problem newchild, Gabriel, who has trouble sleeping through the
night at the Nurturing Center. Jonas helps the child to sleep by
transmitting soothing memories to him every night, and he begins
to develop a relationship with Gabriel that mirrors the family relationships
he has experienced through the memories. When Gabriel is in danger of
being released, the Giver reveals to Jonas that release is the same as
death. Jonas’s rage and horror at this revelation inspire the Giver to
help Jonas devise a plan to change things in the community forever.
The Giver tells Jonas about the girl who had been designated the
new Receiver ten years before. She had been the Giver’s own daughter,
but the sadness of some of the memories had been too much for her
and she had asked to be released. When she died, all of the memories
she had accumulated were released into the community, and the community
members could not handle the sudden influx of emotion and sensation.
The Giver and Jonas plan for Jonas to escape the community and to
actually enter Elsewhere. Once he has done that, his larger supply
of memories will disperse, and the Giver will help the community
to come to terms with the new feelings and thoughts, changing the
society forever."
The GiverLois Lowry,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/giver/summary.html,"Jonas lives with his father, a Nurturer of new children,
his mother, who works at the Department of Justice, and his seven-year-old
sister Lily. At the beginning of the novel, he is apprehensive about
the upcoming Ceremony of Twelve, when he will be given his official
Assignment as a new adult member of the community. He does not have
a distinct career preference, although he enjoys volunteering at
a variety of different jobs. Though he is a well-behaved citizen
and a good student, Jonas is different: he has pale eyes, while most
people in his community have dark eyes, and he has unusual powers
of perception. Sometimes objects “change” when he looks at them.
He does not know it yet, but he alone in his community can perceive
flashes of color; for everyone else, the world is as devoid of color
as it is of pain, hunger, and inconvenience."
The GiverLois Lowry,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/giver/summary.html,"The giver is written
from the point of view of Jonas, an eleven-year-old boy living in
a futuristic society that has eliminated all pain, fear, war, and
hatred. There is no prejudice, since everyone looks and acts basically
the same, and there is very little competition. Everyone is unfailingly
polite. The society has also eliminated choice: at age twelve every
member of the community is assigned a job based on his or her abilities
and interests. Citizens can apply for and be assigned compatible
spouses, and each couple is assigned exactly two children each.
The children are born to Birthmothers, who never see them, and spend
their first year in a Nurturing Center with other babies, or “newchildren,”
born that year. When their children are grown, family units dissolve
and adults live together with Childless Adults until they are too
old to function in the society. Then they spend their last years
being cared for in the House of the Old until they are finally “released”
from the society. In the community, release is death, but it is
never described that way; most people think that after release, flawed
newchildren and joyful elderly people are welcomed into the vast
expanse of Elsewhere that surrounds the communities. Citizens who
break rules or fail to adapt properly to the society’s codes of behavior
are also released, though in their cases it is an occasion of great
shame. Everything is planned and organized so that life is as convenient
and pleasant as possible."

when his father tells him that Gabriel will be released the next
day. Desperate to save Gabriel, Jonas steals his father’s bicycle
and a supply of food and sets off for Elsewhere. Gradually, he enters
a landscape full of color, animals, and changing weather, but also
hunger, danger, and exhaustion. Avoiding search planes, Jonas and
Gabriel travel for a long time until heavy snow makes bike travel
impossible. Half-frozen, but comforting Gabriel with memories of
sunshine and friendship, Jonas mounts a high hill. There he finds
a sled—the sled from his first transmitted memory—waiting for him
at the top. Jonas and Gabriel experience a glorious downhill ride
on the sled. Ahead of them, they see—or think they see—the twinkling
lights of a friendly village at Christmas, and they hear music.
Jonas is sure that someone is waiting for them there."

same night that Offred is to sleep with Nick, the Commander secretly
takes her out to a club called Jezebel’s, where the Commanders mingle
with prostitutes. Offred sees Moira working there. The two women
meet in a bathroom, and Offred learns that Moira was captured just
before she crossed the border. She chose life in Jezebel’s over
being sent to the Colonies, where most political prisoners and dangerous
people are sent. After that night at Jezebel’s, Offred says, she
never sees Moira again. The Commander takes Offred upstairs after
a few hours, and they have sex in what used to be a hotel room.
She tries to feign passion."
The Handmaid’s TaleMargaret Atwood,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/handmaid/summary.html,"Offred is a Handmaid in
the Republic of Gilead, a totalitarian and theocratic state that
has replaced the United States of America. Because of dangerously
low reproduction rates, Handmaids are assigned to bear children
for elite couples that have trouble conceiving. Offred serves the
Commander and his wife, Serena Joy, a former gospel singer and advocate
for “traditional values.” Offred is not the narrator’s real name—Handmaid
names consist of the word “of” followed by the name of the Handmaid’s
Commander. Every month, when Offred is at the right point in her
menstrual cycle, she must have impersonal, wordless sex with the
Commander while Serena sits behind her, holding her hands. Offred’s
freedom, like the freedom of all women, is completely restricted.
She can leave the house only on shopping trips, the door to her
room cannot be completely shut, and the Eyes, Gilead’s secret police
force, watch her every public move."
The Handmaid’s TaleMargaret Atwood,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/handmaid/summary.html,"As Offred tells the story of her daily life, she frequently
slips into flashbacks, from which the reader can reconstruct the
events leading up to the beginning of the novel. In the old world,
before Gilead, Offred had an affair with Luke, a married man. He
divorced his wife and married Offred, and they had a child together.
Offred’s mother was a single mother and feminist activist. Offred’s
best friend, Moira, was fiercely independent. The architects of
Gilead began their rise to power in an age of readily available
pornography, prostitution, and violence against women—when pollution
and chemical spills led to declining fertility rates. Using the
military, they assassinated the president and members of Congress
and launched a coup, claiming that they were taking power temporarily.
They cracked down on women’s rights, forbidding women to hold property
or jobs. Offred and Luke took their daughter and attempted to flee
across the border into Canada, but they were caught and separated
from one another, and Offred has seen neither her husband nor her
daughter since."
The Handmaid’s TaleMargaret Atwood,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/handmaid/summary.html,"Once assigned to the Commander’s house, Offred’s life
settles into a restrictive routine. She takes shopping trips with
Ofglen, another Handmaid, and they visit the Wall outside what used
to be Harvard University, where the bodies of rebels hang. She must
visit the doctor frequently to be checked for disease and other
complications, and she must endure the “Ceremony,” in which the
Commander reads to the household from the Bible, then goes to the bedroom,
where his Wife and Offred wait for him, and has sex with Offred.
The first break from her routine occurs when she visits the doctor
and he offers to have sex with her to get her pregnant, suggesting
that her Commander is probably infertile. She refuses. The doctor
makes her uneasy, but his proposition is too risky—she could be
sent away if caught. After a Ceremony, the Commander sends his gardener
and chauffeur, Nick, to ask Offred to come see him in his study
the following night. She begins visiting him regularly. They play
Scrabble (which is forbidden, since women are not allowed to read),
and he lets her look at old magazines like Vogue. At
the end of these secret meetings, he asks her to kiss him."
The Handmaid’s TaleMargaret Atwood,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/handmaid/summary.html,"The novel closes with an epilogue from 2195,
after Gilead has fallen, written in the form of a lecture given
by Professor Pieixoto. He explains the formation and customs of
Gilead in objective, analytical language. He discusses the significance
of Offred’s story, which has turned up on cassette tapes in Bangor,
Maine. He suggests that Nick arranged Offred’s escape but that her
fate after that is unknown. She could have escaped to Canada or
England, or she could have been recaptured."
The Handmaid’s TaleMargaret Atwood,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/handmaid/summary.html,"Soon after Offred returns from Jezebel’s, late at night,
Serena arrives and tells Offred to go to Nick’s room. Offred and
Nick have sex. Soon they begin to sleep together frequently, without
anyone’s knowledge. Offred becomes caught up in the affair and ignores Ofglen’s
requests that she gather information from the Commander for Mayday.
One day, all the Handmaids take part in a group execution of a supposed
rapist, supervised by Aunt Lydia. Ofglen strikes the first blow.
Later, she tells Offred that the so-called rapist was a member of
Mayday and that she hit him to put him out of his misery."
The Handmaid’s TaleMargaret Atwood,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/handmaid/summary.html,"After her capture, Offred’s marriage was voided (because
Luke had been divorced), and she was sent to the Rachel and Leah
Re-education Center, called the Red Center by its inhabitants. At
the center, women were indoctrinated into Gilead’s ideology in preparation
for becoming Handmaids. Aunt Lydia supervised the women, giving
speeches extolling Gilead’s beliefs that women should be subservient
to men and solely concerned with bearing children. Aunt Lydia also
argued that such a social order ultimately offers women more respect
and safety than the old, pre-Gilead society offered them. Moira
is brought to the Red Center, but she escapes, and Offred does not
know what becomes of her."
The Handmaid’s TaleMargaret Atwood,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/handmaid/summary.html,"During one of their shopping trips, Ofglen reveals to
Offred that she is a member of “Mayday,” an underground organization
dedicated to overthrowing Gilead. Meanwhile, Offred begins to find that
the Ceremony feels different and less impersonal now that she knows
the Commander. Their nighttime conversations begin to touch on the
new order that the Commander and his fellow leaders have created
in Gilead. When Offred admits how unhappy she is, the Commander
remarks, “[Y]ou can’t make an omelette without breaking eggs.”"
The Handmaid’s TaleMargaret Atwood,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/handmaid/summary.html,"Shortly thereafter, Offred goes out shopping, and a new
Ofglen meets her. This new woman is not part of Mayday, and she
tells Offred that the old Ofglen hanged herself when she saw the
secret police coming for her. At home, Serena has found out about
Offred’s trip to Jezebel’s, and she sends her to her room, promising
punishment. Offred waits there, and she sees a black van from the
Eyes approach. Then Nick comes in and tells her that the Eyes are
really Mayday members who have come to save her. Offred leaves with them,
over the Commander’s futile objections, on her way either to prison
or to freedom—she does not know which."

the Bellomont, the out-of-town estate of the wealthy and well-establish
Gus and Judy Trenor. At the Bellomont, Judy regularly throws extravagant

money from Wall Street, she begins to spend lavishly. Later, to her
horror, Trenor tries to proposition her, and she learns that he
has not been investing her money—of which there is none—but rather his

mansion, a nearsighted, scowling woman named Hepzibah, is forced
to open a small store in her home to keep from starving. Hepzibah
considers the store a source of great shame, despite the comforting words
of Uncle Venner, a neighborhood character, and of Holgrave, Hepzibah’s
rebellious young lodger, who practices an early form of photography
known as daguerreotypy. Hepzibah remains pessimistic, and though
she tries her best, her scowling face continues to frighten customers.
The very day that she opens her shop, Hepzibah receives a visit
from Phoebe, a young girl who is Hepzibah’s cousin through an extended
branch of the Pyncheon family. At first, Hepzibah worries that Phoebe’s
presence will upset Hepzibah’s brother, Clifford, who is returning
home from prison. Phoebe’s charm and diligence prevail, however,
and she finally convinces Hepzibah to let her stay. When Clifford
returns, battered and almost imbecilic from his time in prison,
he is quite impressed by Phoebe. Contrary to Hepzibah’s fears, Clifford
is more bothered by their poverty than by her tending to a store."

from the terror inspired by a visit from their cousin, Judge Pyncheon.

and offers her financial support, but she furiously blocks the Judge’s
way into the house, while, from inside, Clifford begs him to go
away. Even the normally unflappable Phoebe experiences a moment
of revulsion when the Judge greets her. Less terrible but equally
strange is Holgrave, the house’s only lodger. He and Phoebe spend
much time together, tending the garden and feeding the house chickens,
a once-mighty breed whose former glory is compared to that of the Pyncheons.
Holgrave explains his radical politics, which revolve around the
principle that each generation should tear down the work of those
before it, and asks Phoebe constantly about Clifford and his past."

A hundred years before, Alice’s father, Gervayse Pyncheon, summoned
the young grandson of the older Matthew Maule, a carpenter also named
Matthew Maule. Gervayse believed that since the younger Matthew
Maule’s father built the Pyncheon house, the young man might know
where to find the missing deed to the Pyncheon land. The younger
Matthew Maule, although bitter at the Pyncheons’ mistreatment of
his family, agrees to help in exchange for the house of the seven
gables and the land on which it stands. He summons the spirits of
his father, grandfather, and old Colonel Pyncheon by hypnotizing
Gervayse’s young daughter, Alice. The two Maule spirits prevent
Colonel Pyncheon’s ghost from telling Gervayse and the younger Matthew
where the deed is, so the carpenter cancels the deal. He is elated
to find that Alice has remained under his spell, and torments her
in cruel and petty ways. On his wedding night, the young Maule forces
Alice to serve his new bride. When Alice awakens from her trance,
she rushes home through the snow, catches pneumonia, and dies. Maule
is devastated by what he has done."

gables and forces Hepzibah to fetch Clifford, saying he will put
Clifford in an asylum if Hepzibah does not retrieve him. The Judge
explains that Clifford knows the location of their late uncle’s inheritance.
Hepzibah cannot find Clifford in his room, but when she comes back
downstairs she finds her brother pointing gleefully to the slumped
figure of Judge Pyncheon. Worried that Clifford will be blamed for
the murder, the brother and sister flee. When Phoebe returns, only
Holgrave is home. He excitedly shows her a daguerreotype of the
dead Judge and tells her that the curse has been lifted. Holgrave
also tells Phoebe he loves her, and she admits to loving him in
return. Although the neighbors become suspicious, Hepzibah and Clifford
return before the body is discovered. Clifford is not suspected
in the Judge’s death, and it is rumored that the Judge himself framed
Clifford for the crime for which he served thirty years in prison.
News arrives that the Judge’s estranged son has died in Europe,

father and the ruler of Troy, into the Achaean camp. Priam tearfully
pleads with Achilles to take pity on a father bereft of his son
and return Hector’s body. He invokes the memory of Achilles’ own
father, Peleus. Deeply moved, Achilles finally relents and returns
Hector’s corpse to the Trojans. Both sides agree to a temporary
truce, and Hector receives a hero’s funeral."

the Trojan War, the Greek (“Achaean”) army sacks Chryse,
a town allied with Troy. During the battle, the Achaeans capture
a pair of beautiful maidens, Chryseis and Briseis. Agamemnon, the
leader of the Achaean forces, takes Chryseis as his prize, and Achilles,
the Achaeans’ greatest warrior, claims Briseis. Chryseis’s father,
Chryses, who serves as a priest of the god Apollo, offers an enormous
ransom in return for his daughter, but Agamemnon refuses to give
Chryseis back. Chryses then prays to Apollo, who sends a plague
upon the Achaean camp."
The Iliad,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/iliad/summary.html,"Meanwhile, Hector, not expecting Achilles to rejoin the
battle, has ordered his men to camp outside the walls of Troy. But
when the Trojan army glimpses Achilles, it flees in terror back
behind the city walls. Achilles cuts down every Trojan he sees.
Strengthened by his rage, he even fights the god of the river Xanthus,
who is angered that Achilles has caused so many corpses to fall
into his streams. Finally, Achilles confronts Hector outside the
walls of Troy. Ashamed at the poor advice that he gave his comrades,
Hector refuses to flee inside the city with them. Achilles chases
him around the city’s periphery three times, but the goddess Athena
finally tricks Hector into turning around and fighting Achilles.
In a dramatic duel, Achilles kills Hector. He then lashes
the body to the back of his chariot and drags it across the battlefield
to the Achaean camp. Upon Achilles’ arrival, the triumphant Achaeans
celebrate Patroclus’s funeral with a long series of athletic games
in his honor. Each day for the next nine days, Achilles drags Hector’s
body in circles around Patroclus’s funeral bier."

to fight, the Achaeans suffer great losses. Several days of fierce
conflict ensue, including duels between Paris and Menelaus and between
Hector and Ajax. The Achaeans make no progress; even the heroism
of the great Achaean warrior Diomedes proves fruitless. The Trojans
push the Achaeans back, forcing them to take refuge behind the ramparts that
protect their ships. The Achaeans begin to nurture some hope for
the future when a nighttime reconnaissance mission by Diomedes and
Odysseus yields information about the Trojans’ plans, but the next
day brings disaster. Several Achaean commanders become wounded,
and the Trojans break through the Achaean ramparts. They advance
all the way up to the boundary of the Achaean camp and set fire
to one of the ships. Defeat seems imminent, because without the
ships, the army will be stranded at Troy and almost certainly destroyed."
The Iliad,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/iliad/summary.html,"After many Achaeans die, Agamemnon consults the prophet
Calchas to determine the cause of the plague. When he learns that
Chryseis is the cause, he reluctantly gives her up but then demands
Briseis from Achilles as compensation. Furious at this insult, Achilles returns
to his tent in the army camp and refuses to fight in the war any
longer. He vengefully yearns to see the Achaeans destroyed and asks
his mother, the sea-nymph Thetis, to enlist the services of Zeus, king
of the gods, toward this end. The Trojan and Achaean sides have
declared a cease-fire with each other, but now the Trojans breach
the treaty and Zeus comes to their aid."

them himself, Achilles agrees to a plan proposed by Nestor that
will allow his beloved friend Patroclus to take his place in battle,
wearing his armor. Patroclus is a fine warrior, and his presence
on the battlefield helps the Achaeans push the Trojans away from
the ships and back to the city walls. But the counterattack soon
falters. Apollo knocks Patroclus’s armor to the ground, and Hector
slays him. Fighting then breaks out as both sides try to lay claim
to the body and armor. Hector ends up with the armor, but the Achaeans,
thanks to a courageous effort by Menelaus and others, manage to
bring the body back to their camp. When Achilles discovers that
Hector has killed Patroclus, he fills with such grief and rage that
he agrees to reconcile with Agamemnon and rejoin the battle. Thetis
goes to Mount Olympus and persuades the god Hephaestus to forge
Achilles a new suit of armor, which she presents to him the next
morning. Achilles then rides out to battle at the head of the Achaean
army."

Cecily and Gwendolen have retired. When Jack and Algernon enter
from the garden, the two women confront them. Cecily asks Algernon
why he pretended to be her guardian’s brother. Algernon tells her
he did it in order to meet her. Gwendolen asks Jack whether he pretended
to have a brother in order to come into London to see her as often
as possible, and she interprets his evasive reply as an affirmation.
The women are somewhat appeased but still concerned over the issue
of the name. However, when Jack and Algernon tell Gwendolen and
Cecily that they have both made arrangements to be christened Ernest

a pillar of the community in Hertfordshire, where he is guardian
to Cecily Cardew, the pretty, eighteen-year-old granddaughter of
the late Thomas Cardew, who found and adopted Jack when he was a
baby. In Hertfordshire, Jack has responsibilities: he is a major
landowner and justice of the peace, with tenants, farmers, and a
number of servants and other employees all dependent on him. For
years, he has also pretended to have an irresponsible black-sheep
brother named Ernest who leads a scandalous life in pursuit of pleasure
and is always getting into trouble of a sort that requires Jack
to rush grimly off to his assistance. In fact, Ernest is merely
Jack’s alibi, a phantom that allows him to disappear for days at
a time and do as he likes. No one but Jack knows that he himself
is Ernest. Ernest is the name Jack goes by in London, which is where
he really goes on these occasions—probably to pursue the very sort
of behavior he pretends to disapprove of in his imaginary brother."

of age, and Jack points out that under the terms of her grandfather’s
will, Cecily does not legally come of age until she is thirty-five.
Lady Bracknell asks Jack to reconsider, and he points out that the
matter is entirely in her own hands. As soon as she consents to his
marriage to Gwendolen, Cecily can have his consent to marry Algernon.
However, Lady Bracknell refuses to entertain the notion. She and
Gwendolen are on the point of leaving when Dr. Chasuble arrives
and happens to mention Cecily’s governess, Miss Prism. At this,
Lady Bracknell starts and asks that Miss Prism be sent for."

attempts to play hostess. Cecily has no idea how Gwendolen figures
into Jack’s life, and Gwendolen, for her part, has no idea who Cecily
is. Gwendolen initially thinks Cecily is a visitor to the Manor
House and is disconcerted to learn that Cecily is “Mr. Worthing’s
ward.” She notes that Ernest has never mentioned having a ward,
and Cecily explains that it is not Ernest Worthing
who is her guardian but his brother Jack and, in fact, that she
is engaged to be married to Ernest Worthing. Gwendolen points out

his name isn’t really Ernest and that Cecily is his ward, a responsibility
imposed on him by his adoptive father’s will. Jack also tells Algernon
about his fictional brother. Jack says he’s been thinking of killing
off this fake brother, since Cecily has been showing too active

suspects that Jack may be leading a double life, a practice he seems

never returned. She demands to know where the baby is. Miss Prism
confesses she doesn’t know, explaining that she lost the baby, having
absentmindedly placed it in a handbag in which she had meant to
place the manuscript for a novel she had written. Jack asks what
happened to the bag, and Miss Prism says she left it in the cloakroom
of a railway station. Jack presses her for further details and goes
racing offstage, returning a few moments later with a large handbag.
When Miss Prism confirms that the bag is hers, Jack throws himself
on her with a cry of “Mother!” It takes a while before the situation
is sorted out, but before too long we understand that Jack is not
the illegitimate child of Miss Prism but the legitimate child of
Lady Bracknell’s sister and, therefore, Algernon’s older brother.
Furthermore, Jack had been originally christened “Ernest John.”
All these years Jack has unwittingly been telling the truth: Ernest is his
name, as is Jack, and he does have an unprincipled younger brother—Algernon.

Granny realizes that she’s dying. She feels surprised and unready. She thinks of small, last-minute advice and instructions she wants to give. Aloud, Granny tells Cornelia that she can’t go yet.

The Joy Luck ClubAmy Tan,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/joyluck/summary.html,"The novel is composed of four sections, each of which
contains four separate narratives. In the first four stories of
the book, the mothers, speaking in turn, recall with astonishing
clarity their relationships with their own mothers, and they worry
that their daughters’ recollections of them will never possess the
same intensity. In the second section, these daughters—Waverly,
Jing-mei, Lena, and Rose—relate their recollections of their childhood
relationships with their mothers; the great lucidity and force with
which they tell their stories proves their mothers’ fears at least
partially unfounded. In the third group of stories, the four daughters
narrate their adult dilemmas—troubles in marriage and with their
careers. Although they believe that their mothers’ antiquated ideas
do not pertain to their own very American lifestyles, their search
for solutions inevitably brings them back to their relationships
with the older generation. In the final group of stories, the mothers
struggle to offer solutions and support to their daughters, in the
process learning more about themselves. Lindo recognizes through
her daughter Waverly that she has been irrevocably changed by American
culture. Ying-ying realizes that Lena has unwittingly followed her
passive example in her marriage to Harold Livotny. An-mei realizes that
Rose has not completely understood the lessons she intended to teach
her about faith and hope."
The Joy Luck ClubAmy Tan,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/joyluck/summary.html,"The Joy Luck Club contains
sixteen interwoven stories about conflicts between Chinese immigrant
mothers and their American-raised daughters. The book hinges on Jing-mei’s
trip to China to meet her half-sisters, twins Chwun Yu and Chwun
Hwa. The half-sisters remained behind in China because
Jing-mei’s mother, Suyuan, was forced to leave them on the roadside
during her desperate flight from Japan’s invasion of Kweilin during
World War II. Jing-mei was born to a different father years later,
in America. Suyuan intended to return to China for her other daughters,
but failed to find them before her death."
The Joy Luck ClubAmy Tan,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/joyluck/summary.html,"Although Jing-mei fears that she cannot adequately portray
her mother’s life, Suyuan’s story permeates the novel via Jing-mei’s voice:
she speaks for Suyuan in the first and fourth sections, the two “mothers’
sections,” of the novel. Suyuan’s story is representative of the
struggle to maintain the mother-daughter bond across cultural and
generational gaps; by telling this story as her mother’s daughter, Jing-mei
enacts and cements the very bond that is the subject of Suyuan’s
story. When Jing-mei finally travels to China and helps her half-sisters
to know a mother they cannot remember, she forges two other mother-daughter
bonds as well. Her journey represents a reconciliation between Suyuan’s
two lives, between two cultures, and between mother and daughter.
This enables Jing-mei to bring closure and resolution to her mother’s
story, but also to her own. In addition, the journey brings hope
to the other members of the Joy Luck Club that they too can reconcile
the oppositions in their lives between
past and present, between cultures, and between generations."

Ying-ying, and An-mei—are three of her mother’s oldest friends and
fellow immigrants. They tell Jing-mei that just before Suyuan died,
she had finally succeeded in locating the address of her lost daughters.
The three women repeatedly urge Jing-mei to travel to China and
tell her sisters about their mother’s life. But Jing-mei wonders
whether she is capable of telling her mother’s story, and the three
older women fear that Jing-mei’s doubts may be justified. They fear
that their own daughters, like Jing-mei, may not know or appreciate
the stories of their mothers’ lives."

When he gets to Eleusis he meets the Companions, who have heard that he traded Eleusis to Athens in return for being pronounced heir to the Athenian throne. He reveals his heritage, makes a rousing speech to the army, and returns home triumphant. He learns that the Queen is dying, having poisoned herself with the House Snake. Theseus changes some of the customs in Eleusis, and helps his father win a war in Athens."
The King Must DieMary Renault,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/kingmustdie/summary.html,"The King Must Die is the story of the hero Theseus. The tale begins in Troizen, the land of Theseus' grandfather, King Pittheus. Theseus believes that he is the son of the sea-god Poseidon. At an early age he discovers that he can sense earthquakes. He interprets this skill as proof of his heritage. Small for his age, Theseus learns to outwrestle larger youths by using his agility. At seventeen he finds out that his father is Aigeus, King of Athens, although Pittheus tells him that Poseidon may have had something to do with his birth. Theseus decides to go to Athens, and he does not take a Cretan ship there after the Cretans in the harbor insult some of his people. Instead he goes through the dangerous Isthmus Road with Dexios, his friend, as charioteer. Dexios is murdered on the journey, but Theseus avenges him and arrives unharmed."
The King Must DieMary Renault,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/kingmustdie/summary.html,"The next day, Asterion tries to fix the bull-dance and have Theseus killed. Although Theseus survives, everyone expects Poseidon to be angered, because his sacred rite has been tampered with. The following morning there are two small earthquakes, and Theseus realizes there is going to be a great earthquake. The bull-dancers break out of the Bull Court, and get outside of the Palace, and Theseus goes back for Ariadne just as the quake hits. He saves her, and then Theseus leads a charge into the remnants of the Palace to kill Asterion, with the native Cretans supporting them. He finds Asterion in the midst of being anointed the next Minos and kills him. They leave the island to return to their homes, bringing Ariadne with them. They stop on the island of Naxos, where Ariadne is highly respected and the Queen there invites them to stay for the feast of Dionysos the next day. At the feast, Ariadne takes part in the sacrifice of the King, and her role is so horrifying to Theseus that he leaves the island without her. He returns to Athens, and learns that his father has committed suicide. Years later, after many other adventures and hardship, in his old age, when Poseidon no longer speaks to him, Theseus knows only that the fate of man is beyond his ability to understand."
The King Must DieMary Renault,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/kingmustdie/summary.html,"Theseus comes to Eleusis on the day when the king must die, and the queen tells Theseus that he must wrestle with the current king. In Eleusis, as in some other kingdoms of the Minyans, Mother Dia is the supreme deity, and the queen reigns supreme. The king, named Kerkyon in Eleusis, is killed each year. After Theseus kills the king, he sleeps with the queen and becomes Kerkyon himself. But Theseus does not come from the same background as the other people from Eleusis, and he does not act the same as other Kerkyons before him. He trains his personal guard, the Companions, and makes them warriors. He proves to the queen that he is in charge. Theseus befriends Pylas, the heir to the neighboring Megarian throne, and together the two kingdoms wipe out all of the thieves in the Isthmus Road. Xanthos, the Queen's brother, tries to have Theseus killed in the battle, but Theseus kills him in armed combat. Then Theseus goes on to Athens to meet his father."

Along with seven girls and six boys, all from Athens or Eleusis, Theseus heads to Crete as a slave. In Crete he meets Asterion. Minos' heir is evil and hungry for power. Although his attempt to embarrass Theseus fails, he still treats the King of Eleusis as an inferior. They go to Knossos Palace, known as the House of the Ax, a place whose immensity shocks Theseus. There, the group of slaves, bound together by an oath and calling themselves the Cranes, begins training to be bull-dancers. Theseus watches the Corinthian, who is the best of the bull-leapers, the most prized position for a bull-dancer. Over time, the Cranes become the best group and Theseus becomes the best bull-leaper. Ariadne, Minos' daughter and the Goddess-on-Earth, falls in love with him, and he begins plans to escape from Crete. He meets King Minos, who has leprosy, and learns that the King wants him to marry Ariadne and become the next Minos. But Asterion is very powerful and it will be tough to oppose him.

The biggest secret, however, that Winnie tells her daughter, is that before Winnie was able to escape her marriage, Wen Fu raped her and that Wen Fu is Pearl's real father. Winnie tells her daughter also that it is only now that she feels truly free from Wen Fu's wickedness and his threats, because she has received news of his death."

Auntie Helen tells Pearl that Pearl must tell her mother Winnie about Pearl's multiple sclerosis, which everyone in the family knows about, except for Winnie. Helen says that Pearl must do this because Helen believes that Helen has a malignant brain tumor and does not want to die knowing that Winnie does not know this about her daughter. Helen continues by saying that if Winnie will not tell her mother the truth, Helen will be forced to do so herself. Later, Helen pulls Winnie's mother aside as well and tells Winnie that she must unveil the secrets of her past to her daughter because she cannot go to her grave with such secrets.

Winnie, whose name in China was Weili, is forced to live with her Uncle and his two wives (New Aunt and Old Aunt). She never feels as loved as her uncle's true daughter, Weili's cousin, Peanut. Nevertheless, when the time comes, Winnie's aunts arrange a traditional marriage for her, and her father provides a large dowry, since he is an educated and well-established man. The marriage, however, to a man named Wen Fu, turns out to be a terrible one. Wen Fu is horribly abusive—physically, mentally, and emotionally. Winnie manages to suffer through her manage while surviving World War II. She loses many children along the way, some to early deaths and one that was stillborn. It is during the War that Winnie becomes friends with Helen, whose name in China was Hulan. By telling her daughter about this friendship, Winnie is revealing that Helen and Winnie are not really in-laws as the family in America believes, but only friends who have gone through much hardship together. Winnie had had to lie and say that Helen was her dead brother's first wife in order to bring Helen to the United States, after Winnie had already been in the United States for a while.

Right away, Pearl feels a reluctance to oblige her mother, since she is more involved in her American identity—perhaps a result of her marriage to Phil, an American—than her Chinese background.

Then, two days before the engagement party, Pearl receives another call from her mother telling her that Auntie Du has died and that the funeral will be arranged for the day after the engagement party.

However, as the boat comes closer True Son sees that there is a boy Gordie's age on the boat. He becomes frightened that Gordie may be on the boat and ruins the ambush attempt. Although Little Crane's family votes to burn True Son for his betrayal, Cuyloga saves his son from death with a very moving speech.

However, just as True Son seems to lose almost all faith in ever seeing Tuscarawas again, his cousin Half Arrow secretly comes to see him one night. True Son sneaks out with his cousin, but their reunion is bittersweet because True Son learns that Little Crane, who had accompanied Half Arrow to Paxton township, was killed by Uncle Wilse the previous night.

True Son and Half Arrow go to Uncle Wilse's house to demand an explanation, but they end up half-scalping the man and then fleeing into the night."

in life are visible only to the heart, that his time away from the rose
makes the rose more special to him, and that love makes a person
responsible for the beings that one loves. The little prince realizes
that, even though there are many roses, his love for his rose makes
her unique and that he is therefore responsible for her. Despite

fixed on returning to his rose, and he begins making plans with
the snake to head back to his planet. The narrator is able to fix

Another knock sounds, and Mr. White dashes upstairs. Mrs. White hears the third knock and says it’s Herbert.

Sir John Herncastle, a dishonorable man and family outcast, has left the Moonstone to Lady Verinder's daughter Rachel to be given to her on her eighteenth birthday. Franklin Blake has been appointed to deliver the diamond. Franklin suspects that John Herncastle knew that his life was in danger because of the Moonstone and that John had willed the ill-fated diamond to Rachel as a gesture of malice towards Lady Verinder. Franklin's suspicions are further roused when he notices Indian men following him, both in London and at Lady Verinder's country estate."

When Franklin and Sergeant Cuff locate the sailor, the man has been killed. The sailor is Godfrey Ablewhite, disguised. Cuff correctly determines that Godfrey has been leading a double life. Franklin, under in the influence of opium, had given the gem to Godfrey after taking it from Rachel's room and asked Godfrey to store it safely in his father's bank. Godfrey had kept the gem and pawned it for money and had just redeemed it and was planning to take it to Europe to be cut up and sold. He had been killed by the Indians, who have returned to India with the Moonstone and restored it to the forehead of their idol."

In the morning, the diamond is gone and Superintendent Seegrave of the local police is called. Rachel acts strangely, refusing to help with the investigation and treats Franklin harshly. Seegrave proves himself inept, and Franklin calls for the famed Sergeant Cuff of London to take over the case. Cuff suspects Rosanna Spearman, a housemaid of Lady Verinder's and a reformed thief, of having played a part in the theft. Cuff believes that Rosanna was working in cooperation with Rachel Verinder, who stole her own diamond to pay personal debts. Several days after the theft, Cuff tracks Rosanna and finds that she has gone to great pains to hide a package and has then committed suicide. Lady Verinder's household is in disarray at the startling news of Rosanna's death and the incredible news of Cuff's suspicion of honest Rachel. Cuff is dismissed from the case, and Lady Verinder moves her household to London in hopes of distracting Rachel, who seems distraught, but will not explain herself."

Mr. Bruff, the family lawyer, next explains that Rachel broke off the engagement because she had information that Godfrey intended to marry her for money (Lady Verinder has recently died, and Rachel is now an heiress). Mr. Bruff also notes the continued presence of the Indians in London, who seem to have tracked the diamond to the bank of one moneylender, Septimus Luker, to whom the diamond seems to have been pledged."

John Herncastle, while fighting for the British Army in India in 1799, killed the three Brahmins who were then guarding the diamond and took it back to England with him."
The MoonstoneWilkie Collins,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/moonstone/summary.html,"Franklin continues investigating, hoping to clear his name. Ezra Jennings, assistant to Lady Verinder's doctor, Dr. Candy, provides an explanation. Mr. Candy fell ill the night of Rachel's birthday and had been nearly unintelligible since, but Jennings believes that Candy had given Franklin a dose of opium without telling him in order to settle a dispute about modern medicine. Franklin took the diamond under the influence of the drug, reacting to his anxiety about the safety of the gem. This hypothesis is proven when Jennings stages a reenactment of the night the gem was stolen, and Franklin replicates his actions exactly, again under the influence of opium. Franklin is vindicated, and Franklin and Rachel are reconciled and engaged."

Ashima and Ashoke agree to register the boy’s legal name as “Gogol.”Gogol is Ashoke’s favorite author, in part because Ashoke was reading Gogol during the train accident.

The New Testament,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/newtestament/summary.html,"The New Testament is
a collection of twenty-seven books centered on the figure of Jesus
of Nazareth. Each of these books has its own author, context, theme,
and persuasive purpose. Combined, they comprise one of history’s
most abundant, diverse, complex, and fascinating texts. The books
of the New Testament are traditionally divided into three categories:
the Gospels, the Epistles, and the Book of Revelation."
The New Testament,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/newtestament/summary.html,"The twenty-one books following Acts are epistles, or letters,
written from church leaders to churches in various parts of the
world. The first fourteen of these letters are called the “Epistles
of Paul” and are letters that tradition has accorded to St. Paul
in his correspondence with the earliest churches in the first and
second century. Historians are fairly certain that Paul himself,
Christianity’s first theologian and successful missionary, indisputably
composed seven of the letters, and possibly could have written seven
others."
The New Testament,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/newtestament/summary.html,"The last book in the New Testament is the Revelation to
John, or Book of Revelation, the New Testament’s only piece of literature
in the apocalyptic genre. It describes a vision by a leader of a
church community in Asia Minor living under the persecution of the Roman
Empire."
The New Testament,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/newtestament/summary.html,"Acts of the Apostles follows John, although it was intended
to be the second volume of a single unit beginning with Luke. The
same author wrote Luke and Acts consecutively, and while Luke is
a Gospel about Jesus, Acts picks up the story at the resurrection,
when the early disciples are commissioned to witness to the world.
Acts is a chronological history of the first church of Christ."
The New Testament,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/newtestament/summary.html,"The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are known as the
synoptic—meaning “at one look”—Gospels because each one tells a
similar story, differing only in some additions, special emphases,
and particular omissions according to the interests of the author
and the message the text is trying to convey. Each of the synoptic
Gospels tells the story of Jesus of Nazareth, including
his ministry, gathering of disciples, trial, crucifixion, and, in
the case of Matthew and Luke, his resurrection. John is also a Gospel,
though it is not placed with the synoptic Gospels because his story
is so different. Rather than recording many of the facts about Jesus’s
life, the Gospel according to John focuses on the mystery and identity
of Jesus as the Son of God."
The New Testament,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/newtestament/summary.html,"The seven letters following the Epistles of Paul are
called the Catholic Epistles, because they are addressed to the
church as a whole rather than to particular church communities.
These letters identify as their authors original apostles, biological
brothers of Jesus, and John the Evangelist, although it is thought
that they were actually written by students or followers of these
early church luminaries. The first of the Catholic Epistles is the
Letter of James, attributed to James, the brother of Jesus and leader
of the Christian church in Jerusalem. Next are the First and Second
Letters of Peter, which identify themselves as letters
from the apostle Peter. The First, Second, and Third Letters of
John attribute their authorship to John the Evangelist, and the
Letter of Jude attributes itself to Jude, the brother of James,
who is elsewhere identified as one of Jesus’s brothers."

in this strange beggar, suspecting that he might be her long-lost
husband. Quite crafty herself, Penelope organizes an archery contest
the following day and promises to marry any man who can string Odysseus’s
great bow and fire an arrow through a row of twelve axes—a feat
that only Odysseus has ever been able to accomplish. At the contest,
each suitor tries to string the bow and fails. Odysseus steps up
to the bow and, with little effort, fires an arrow through all twelve
axes. He then turns the bow on the suitors. He and Telemachus, assisted

Oedipus: his death seemed a disappearance of sorts, “the lightless
depths of Earth bursting open in kindness to receive him” (1886–1887).
Just as the messenger finishes his story, Antigone and Ismene come onstage,
chanting a dirge. Antigone wails that they will cry for Oedipus
for as long as they live. Not knowing where to go now, Antigone says
they will have to wander forever alone. Theseus returns to the stage,
asking the daughters to stop their weeping. They plead to see their
father’s tomb, but Theseus insists that Oedipus has forbidden it.
They give up their pleas but ask for safe passage back to Thebes, so
that they may prevent a war between their brothers. Theseus grants
them this, and the Chorus tells the girls to stop their weeping, for
all rests in the hands of the gods. Theseus and the Chorus exit toward
Athens; Antigone and Ismene head for Thebes."
The Oedipus PlaysSophocles,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/oedipus/summary.html,"After Tiresias leaves, Oedipus threatens Creon with death
or exile for conspiring with the prophet. Oedipus’s wife, Jocasta
(also the widow of King Laius), enters and asks why the men shout
at one another. Oedipus explains to Jocasta that the prophet has
charged him with Laius’s murder, and Jocasta replies that all prophecies
are false. As proof, she notes that the Delphic oracle once told
Laius he would be murdered by his son, when in fact his son was
cast out of Thebes as a baby, and Laius was murdered by a band of
thieves. Her description of Laius’s murder, however, sounds familiar
to Oedipus, and he asks further questions. Jocasta tells him that
Laius was killed at a three-way crossroads, just before Oedipus
arrived in Thebes. Oedipus, stunned, tells his wife that he may
be the one who murdered Laius. He tells Jocasta that, long ago,
when he was the prince of Corinth, he overheard someone mention
at a banquet that he was not really the son of the king and queen.
He therefore traveled to the oracle of Delphi, who did not answer
him but did tell him he would murder his father and sleep with his
mother. Hearing this, Oedipus fled his home, never to return. It
was then, on the journey that would take him to Thebes, that Oedipus
was confronted and harassed by a group of travelers, whom he killed
in self-defense. This skirmish occurred at the very crossroads where
Laius was killed."

he sees the truth and flees back into the palace. The shepherd and
the messenger slowly exit the stage. A second messenger enters and
describes scenes of suffering. Jocasta has hanged herself, and Oedipus,
finding her dead, has pulled the pins from her robe and stabbed
out his own eyes. Oedipus now emerges from the palace, bleeding
and begging to be exiled. He asks Creon to send him away from Thebes
and to look after his daughters, Antigone and Ismene. Creon, covetous
of royal power, is all too happy to oblige."
The Oedipus PlaysSophocles,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/oedipus/summary.html,"The messenger remarks that Oedipus need not worry, because Polybus
and his wife, Merope, are not Oedipus’s biological parents. The
messenger, a shepherd by profession, knows firsthand that Oedipus
came to Corinth as an orphan. One day long ago, he was tending his
sheep when another shepherd approached him carrying a baby, its
ankles pinned together. The messenger took the baby to the royal
family of Corinth, and they raised him as their own. That baby was
Oedipus. Oedipus asks who the other shepherd was, and the messenger
answers that he was a servant of Laius."

he is, Oedipus’s second daughter, Ismene, enters, having gone to
learn news from Apollo’s oracle at Delphi. She tells him that, back
in Thebes, Oedipus’s younger son, Eteocles, has overthrown Polynices,
the elder, and that Polynices is now amassing troops in Argos for
an attack on his brother and on Creon, who rules along with Eteocles.
The oracle has predicted that the burial place of Oedipus will bring
good fortune to the city in which it is located, and both sons,
as well as Creon, know of this prophecy. Both Polynices and Creon
are currently en route to try to take Oedipus into custody and thus
claim the right to bury him in their kingdoms. Oedipus swears he
will never give his support to either of his sons, for they did
nothing to prevent his exile years ago."

to take whatever advice he gives. Tiresias advises that Creon allow Polynices
to be buried, but Creon refuses. Tiresias predicts that the gods
will bring down curses upon the city. The words of Tiresias strike
fear into the hearts of Creon and the people of Thebes, and Creon
reluctantly goes to free Antigone from the tomb where she has been
imprisoned. But his change of heart comes too late. A messenger
enters and recounts the tragic events: Creon and his entourage first
gave proper burial to Polynices, then heard what sounded like Haemon’s
voice wailing from Antigone’s tomb. They went in and saw Antigone
hanging from a noose, and Haemon raving. Creon’s son then took a
sword and thrust it at his father. Missing, he turned the sword
against himself and died embracing Antigone’s body. Creon’s wife,
Eurydice, hears this terrible news and rushes away into the palace.
Creon enters, carrying Haemon’s body and wailing against his own
tyranny, which he knows has caused his son’s death. The messenger
tells Creon that he has another reason to grieve: Eurydice has stabbed
herself, and, as she died, she called down curses on her husband
for the misery his pride had caused. Creon kneels and prays that
he, too, might die. His guards lead him back into the palace."
The Oedipus PlaysSophocles,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/oedipus/summary.html,"Oedipus asks that this shepherd be brought forth to testify,
but Jocasta, beginning to suspect the truth, begs her husband not
to seek more information. She runs back into the palace. The shepherd
then enters. Oedipus interrogates him, asking who gave him the baby. The
shepherd refuses to disclose anything, and Oedipus threatens him
with torture. Finally, he answers that the child came from the house
of Laius. Questioned further, he answers that the baby was in fact
the child of Laius himself, and that it was Jocasta who gave him the
infant, ordering him to kill it, as it had been prophesied that
the child would kill his parents. But the shepherd pitied the child,
and decided that the prophecy could be avoided just as well if the
child were to grow up in a foreign city, far from his true parents.
The shepherd therefore passed the boy on to the shepherd in Corinth."
The Oedipus PlaysSophocles,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/oedipus/summary.html,"Oedipus sends for the man who survived the attack, a shepherd, in
the hope that he will not be identified as the murderer. Outside
the palace, a messenger approaches Jocasta and tells her that he
has come from Corinth to inform Oedipus that his father, Polybus,
is dead, and that Corinth has asked Oedipus to come and rule there
in his place. Jocasta rejoices, convinced that Polybus’s death from
natural causes has disproved the prophecy that Oedipus would murder his
father. At Jocasta’s summons, Oedipus comes outside, hears the news,
and rejoices with her. He now feels much more inclined to agree
with the queen in deeming prophecies worthless and viewing chance
as the principle governing the world. But while Oedipus finds great
comfort in the fact that one-half of the prophecy has been disproved,
he still fears the other half—the half that claimed he would sleep
with his mother."
The Oedipus PlaysSophocles,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/oedipus/summary.html,"Antigone and Ismene, the daughters of Oedipus, discuss
the disaster that has just befallen them. Their brothers Polynices
and Eteocles have killed one another in a battle for control over
Thebes. Creon now rules the city, and he has ordered that Polynices,
who brought a foreign army against Thebes, not be allowed proper burial
rites. Creon threatens to kill anyone who tries to bury Polynices
and stations sentries over his body. Antigone, in spite of Creon’s
edict and without the help of her sister Ismene, resolves to give
their brother a proper burial. Soon, a nervous sentry arrives at the
palace to tell Creon that, while the sentries slept, someone gave Polynices
burial rites. Creon says that he thinks some of the dissidents of
the city bribed the sentry to perform the rites, and he vows to
execute the sentry if no other suspect is found."

a citizen that they are standing on holy ground, reserved for the
Eumenides, goddesses of fate. Oedipus sends the citizen to fetch
Theseus, the king of Athens and its surroundings. Oedipus tells
Antigone that, earlier in his life, when Apollo prophesied his doom,
the god promised Oedipus that he would come to rest on this ground."

the palace of their king, Oedipus, asking him to take action. Oedipus
replies that he already sent his brother-in-law, Creon, to the oracle
at Delphi to learn how to help the city. Creon returns with a message
from the oracle: the plague will end when the murderer of Laius,
former king of Thebes, is caught and expelled; the murderer is within
the city. Oedipus questions Creon about the murder of Laius, who
was killed by thieves on his way to consult an oracle. Only one
of his fellow travelers escaped alive. Oedipus promises to solve
the mystery of Laius’s death, vowing to curse and drive out the
murderer."

in order to gain custody of his eventual burial site. Oedipus asks
Theseus to drive Polynices away, but Antigone convinces her father
to listen to his son. Polynices tells Oedipus that he never condoned
his exile, and that Eteocles is the bad son, having bribed the men
of Thebes to turn against Polynices. Oedipus responds with a terrible
curse, upbraiding his son for letting him be sent into exile, and
predicting that Eteocles and Polynices will die at one another’s
hands. Polynices, realizing he will never win his father’s support,
turns to his sisters. He asks that they provide him with a proper
burial should he die in battle. Antigone embraces Polynices, saying
that he is condemning himself to death, but he resolutely says that
his life remains in the hands of the gods. He prays for the safety
of his sisters and then leaves for Thebes."

Antigone in the act of attempting to rebury her brother, the sentries
having disinterred him. Antigone freely confesses her act to Creon
and says that he himself defies the will of the gods by refusing
Polynices burial. Creon condemns both Antigone and Ismene
to death. Haemon, Creon’s son and Antigone’s betrothed, enters the
stage. Creon asks him his opinion on the issue. Haemon
seems at first to side with his father, but gradually admits his
opposition to Creon’s stubbornness and petty vindictiveness. Creon
curses him and threatens to slay Antigone before his very eyes.
Haemon storms out. Creon decides to pardon Ismene, but vows to kill
Antigone by walling her up alive in a tomb."

him what he knows about the murder. Tiresias responds cryptically,
lamenting his ability to see the truth when the truth brings nothing
but pain. At first he refuses to tell Oedipus what he knows. Oedipus
curses and insults the old man, going so far as to accuse him of
the murder. These taunts provoke Tiresias into revealing that Oedipus
himself is the murderer. Oedipus naturally refuses to believe Tiresias’s
accusation. He accuses Creon and Tiresias of conspiring against
his life, and charges Tiresias with insanity. He asks why Tiresias
did nothing when Thebes suffered under a plague once before. At
that time, a Sphinx held the city captive and refused to leave until
someone answered her riddle. Oedipus brags that he alone was able
to solve the puzzle. Tiresias defends his skills as a prophet, noting
that Oedipus’s parents found him trustworthy. At this mention of
his parents, Oedipus, who grew up in the distant city of Corinth,
asks how Tiresias knew his parents. But Tiresias answers enigmatically.
Then, before leaving the stage, Tiresias puts forth one last riddle,
saying that the murderer of Laius will turn out to be both father
and brother to his own children, and the son of his own wife."
The Oedipus PlaysSophocles,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/oedipus/summary.html,"Terrible thunder sounds, and the Chorus cries out in horror. Oedipus
says that his time of death has come. Sending for Theseus, he tells
the king he must carry out certain rites on his body, and that by
doing so he may assure divine protection to his city. Theseus says that
he believes Oedipus and asks what to do. Oedipus answers that he
will lead the king to the place where he will die, and that Theseus must
never reveal that spot, but pass it on to his son at his own death,
who in turn must pass it on to his own son. In this way Theseus
and his heirs may always rule over a safe city. Oedipus then strides
off with a sudden strength, taking his daughters and Theseus to
his grave."

The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemingway,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oldman/summary.html,"Unable to tie the line fast to the boat for fear the fish
would snap a taut line, the old man bears the strain of the line
with his shoulders, back, and hands, ready to give slack should
the marlin make a run. The fish pulls the boat all through the day,
through the night, through another day, and through another night.
It swims steadily northwest until at last it tires and swims east
with the current. The entire time, Santiago endures constant pain
from the fishing line. Whenever the fish lunges, leaps, or makes
a dash for freedom, the cord cuts Santiago badly. Although wounded and
weary, the old man feels a deep empathy and admiration for the marlin,
his brother in suffering, strength, and resolve."
The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemingway,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oldman/summary.html,"As Santiago sails on with the fish, the marlin’s blood
leaves a trail in the water and attracts sharks. The first to attack
is a great mako shark, which Santiago manages to slay with the harpoon.
In the struggle, the old man loses the harpoon and lengths of valuable rope,
which leaves him vulnerable to other shark attacks. The old man
fights off the successive vicious predators as best he can, stabbing
at them with a crude spear he makes by lashing a knife to an oar,
and even clubbing them with the boat’s tiller. Although he kills several
sharks, more and more appear, and by the time night falls, Santiago’s
continued fight against the scavengers is useless. They devour the
marlin’s precious meat, leaving only skeleton, head, and tail. Santiago
chastises himself for going “out too far,” and for sacrificing his
great and worthy opponent. He arrives home before daybreak, stumbles
back to his shack, and sleeps very deeply."
The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemingway,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oldman/summary.html,"On the third day the fish tires, and Santiago, sleep-deprived,
aching, and nearly delirious, manages to pull the marlin in close
enough to kill it with a harpoon thrust. Dead beside the skiff,
the marlin is the largest Santiago has ever seen. He lashes it to
his boat, raises the small mast, and sets sail for home. While Santiago
is excited by the price that the marlin will bring at market, he
is more concerned that the people who will eat the fish are unworthy
of its greatness."
The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemingway,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oldman/summary.html,"On the eighty-fifth day of his unlucky streak, Santiago
does as promised, sailing his skiff far beyond the island’s shallow
coastal waters and venturing into the Gulf Stream. He prepares his
lines and drops them. At noon, a big fish, which he knows is a marlin,
takes the bait that Santiago has placed one hundred fathoms deep
in the waters. The old man expertly hooks the fish, but he cannot
pull it in. Instead, the fish begins to pull the boat."
The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemingway,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oldman/summary.html,"The next morning, a crowd of amazed fishermen gathers
around the skeletal carcass of the fish, which is still lashed to
the boat. Knowing nothing of the old man’s struggle, tourists at
a nearby café observe the remains of the giant marlin and mistake
it for a shark. Manolin, who has been worried sick over the old
man’s absence, is moved to tears when he finds Santiago safe in
his bed. The boy fetches the old man some coffee and the daily papers
with the baseball scores, and watches him sleep. When the old man
wakes, the two agree to fish as partners once more. The old man
returns to sleep and dreams his usual dream of lions at play on
the beaches of Africa."
The Old Man and the SeaErnest Hemingway,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oldman/summary.html,"The Old Man and the Sea is
the story of an epic struggle between an old, seasoned fisherman
and the greatest catch of his life. For eighty-four days, Santiago,
an aged Cuban fisherman, has set out to sea and returned empty-handed.
So conspicuously unlucky is he that the parents of his young, devoted
apprentice and friend, Manolin, have forced the boy to leave the
old man in order to fish in a more prosperous boat. Nevertheless,
the boy continues to care for the old man upon his return each night.
He helps the old man tote his gear to his ramshackle hut, secures
food for him, and discusses the latest developments in American
baseball, especially the trials of the old man’s hero, Joe DiMaggio.
Santiago is confident that his unproductive streak will soon come
to an end, and he resolves to sail out farther than usual the following
day."

of the nation in 587 b.c. In
the books of Joshua and Judges, the Israelites successfully conquer
the land promised to them by God, but they disobey God by worshipping
the deities of the surrounding peoples. Neighboring nations invade
and oppress the Israelites. God saves the people of Israel by designating
judges, or rulers, to lead the people in warding off their enemies."
The Old Testament,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/oldtestament/summary.html,"The Writings are placed after the historical
books in the Christian Bible. Some of these are narratives covering
the time of Israel’s exile in other nations and its eventual return

a unique tone, style, and message. Individually, they include stories,

As king, Solomon expands Israel into an empire and builds a great
temple in Jerusalem. Solomon disobeys God by worshipping other deities,
and, at his death, the kingdom splits into a northern kingdom, Israel,
and a southern kingdom, Judah. A host of evil kings leads the two

Table. Then, with the help of two French kings, Bors and Ban, Arthur defeats
Lot’s army at the battle of Bedegraine. With her four children,
Morgause travels to Arthur’s court, supposedly to reconcile Arthur

the help of an estranged friend, a doctor, whom he blackmails. The
night after the murder, Dorian makes his way to an opium den, where

pleasure. He falls in love with Sibyl Vane, a young actress who
performs in a theater in London’s slums. He adores her acting; she,
in turn, refers to him as “Prince Charming” and refuses to heed
the warnings of her brother, James Vane, that Dorian is no good
for her. Overcome by her emotions for Dorian, Sibyl decides that
she can no longer act, wondering how she can pretend to love on
the stage now that she has experienced the real thing. Dorian, who
loves Sibyl because of her ability to act, cruelly
breaks his engagement with her. After doing so, he returns home
to notice that his face in Basil’s portrait of him has changed:
it now sneers. Frightened that his wish for his likeness in the
painting to bear the ill effects of his behavior has come true and
that his sins will be recorded on the canvas, he resolves to make
amends with Sibyl the next day. The following afternoon, however,
Lord Henry brings news that Sibyl has killed herself. At Lord Henry’s
urging, Dorian decides to consider her death a sort of artistic
triumph—she personified tragedy—and to put the matter behind him.
Meanwhile, Dorian hides his portrait in a remote upper room of his
house, where no one other than he can watch its transformation."
The Picture of Dorian GrayOscar Wilde,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/doriangray/summary.html,"In the stately London home of
his aunt, Lady Brandon, the well-known artist Basil Hallward meets
Dorian Gray. Dorian is a cultured, wealthy, and impossibly beautiful
young man who immediately captures Basil’s artistic imagination.
Dorian sits for several portraits, and Basil often depicts him as
an ancient Greek hero or a mythological figure. When the novel opens,
the artist is completing his first portrait of Dorian as he truly
is, but, as he admits to his friend Lord Henry Wotton, the painting
disappoints him because it reveals too much of his feeling for his
subject. Lord Henry, a famous wit who enjoys scandalizing
his friends by celebrating youth, beauty, and the selfish pursuit
of pleasure, disagrees, claiming that the portrait is Basil’s masterpiece.
Dorian arrives at the studio, and Basil reluctantly introduces him
to Lord Henry, who he fears will have a damaging influence on the impressionable,
young Dorian."
The PlagueAlbert Camus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/plague/summary.html,"The public reacts to their sudden imprisonment with intense longing for absent loved ones. They indulge in selfish personal distress, convinced that their pain is unique in comparison to common suffering. Father Paneloux delivers a stern sermon, declaring that the plague is God's punishment for Oran's sins. Raymond Rambert endeavors to escape Oran to rejoin his wife in Paris, but the city's bureaucrats refuse to let him leave. He tries to escape by illegal means with the help of Cottard's criminal associates. Meanwhile, Rieux, Tarrou, and Grand doggedly battle the death and suffering wrought by the plague. Rambert finalizes his escape plan, but, after Tarrou tells him that Rieux is likewise separated from his wife, Rambert is ashamed to flee. He chooses to stay behind and help fight the epidemic. Cottard committed a crime (which he does not name) in the past, so he has lived in constant fear of arrest and punishment. He greets the plague epidemic with open arms because he no longer feels alone in his fearful suffering. He accumulates a great deal of wealth as a smuggler during the epidemic."
The PlagueAlbert Camus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/plague/summary.html,"When the epidemic ends, Cottard cannot cope. He begins randomly firing his gun into the street until he is captured by the police. Grand, having recovered from a bout of plague, vows to make a fresh start in life. Tarrou dies just as the epidemic is waning, but he battles with all his strength for his life, just as he helped Rieux battle for the lives of others. Rambert's wife joins him in Oran after the city gates are finally opened, but Dr. Rieux's own wife dies of a prolonged illness before she and her husband can be reunited. The public quickly returns to its old routine, but Rieux knows that the battle against the plague is never over because the bacillus microbe can lie dormant for years. The Plague is his chronicle of the scene of human suffering that all too many people are willing to forget."
The PlagueAlbert Camus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/plague/summary.html,"The Plague is a novel about a plague epidemic in the large Algerian city of Oran. In April, thousands of rats stagger into the open and die. When a mild hysteria grips the population, the newspapers begin clamoring for action. The authorities finally arrange for the daily collection and cremation of the rats. Soon thereafter, M. Michel, the concierge for the building where Dr. Rieux works, dies after falling ill with a strange fever. When a cluster of similar cases appears, Dr. Rieux's colleague, Castel, becomes certain that the illness is the bubonic plague. He and Dr. Rieux are forced to confront the indifference and denial of the authorities and other doctors in their attempts to urge quick, decisive action. Only after it becomes impossible to deny that a serious epidemic is ravaging Oran, do the authorities enact strict sanitation measures, placing the whole city under quarantine."
The PlagueAlbert Camus,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/plague/summary.html,"After the term of exile lasts several months, many of Oran's citizens lose their selfish obsession with personal suffering. They come to recognize the plague as a collective disaster that is everyone's concern. They confront their social responsibility and join the anti-plague efforts. When M. Othon's small son suffers a prolonged, excruciating death from the plague, Dr. Rieux shouts at Paneloux that he was an innocent victim. Paneloux, deeply shaken by the boy's death, delivers a second sermon that modifies the first. He declares that the inexplicable deaths of innocents force the Christian to choose between believing everything and believing nothing about God. When he falls ill, he refuses to consult a doctor, leaving his fate entirely in the hands of divine Providence. He dies clutching his crucifix, but the symptoms of his illness do not match those of the plague. Dr. Rieux records him as a ""doubtful case."""
The Poisonwood BibleBarbara Kingsolver,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/poisonwood/summary.html,"In 1959 an overzealous Baptist minister named Nathan Price drags his wife and four daughters deep into the heart of the Congo on a mission to save the unenlightened souls of Africa. The five women narrate the novel. From the outset, the attitudes of the five women cover a wide spectrum. The mother, Orleanna passively accepts the turn of events, as she passively accepts everything her husband tells her. Fifteen-year-old beauty queen Rachel resents her separation from normal teen life. Five year old adventurer Ruth May is both excited and frightened. Fourteen-year-old Leah, who alone shares her father's ardent religious faith, is enthusiastic. Leah's twin Adah a cripple and mute by birth, but also a brilliant observer, merely views the move, as she does all of life, with a wry and cynical detachment. One thing that the women share, however, is the unwavering faith that they are carrying with them a culture far superior to the one already existing in the village of Kilanga, and that they will therefore instantly be masters of their new domain."
The Poisonwood BibleBarbara Kingsolver,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/poisonwood/summary.html,"Though the women are shaken by these events, and slowly affected by the culture around them, Nathan remains steadfast in his original goals. He refuses to give up the attempt to baptize the villagers, or to bend his will in any way. When the only English-speaking member of the village, the handsome young school teacher, Anatole, informs Nathan that the chief, Tata Ndu, looks askance at his proselytizing, and fears that a move toward Christianity will spell the moral decline of his people, Nathan becomes outraged and throws Anatole out of his house rather than trying to gather more insight from him into the traditional religious life of the village. Even when their situation becomes mortally dangerous, Nathan clings tenaciously to his mission. Though little progress is being made in Kilanga, tremendous shifts are taking place elsewhere in the Congo. As the Underdowns, the Price's contacts to the Mission League, inform them on a surprise visit, Belgium is about to give the country its independence; a popular election will be held to select the new ruler. The Underdowns warn the Prices that they must evacuate the country, as purges of all Westerners are expected to take place once independence is won. Though his wife and daughters plead with him to heed this suggestion, Nathan refuses. The day that the evacuation plane arrives, and Nathan forbids his family to board, Orleanna crawls into bed and finds herself unable or unwilling to get up."
The Poisonwood BibleBarbara Kingsolver,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/poisonwood/summary.html,"A dry spell hits Kilanga and the people begin to starve. They organize a tremendous hunt, and controversy breaks out over whether Leah, who has become an excellent marksman under her friend Nelson's direction, can partake. The issue is put to a vote, which goes in favor of Leah's participation. Chief Ndu and the village's religious leader Tata Kuvundu are outraged by the idea of a woman participating in the hunt. Tata Kuvundu ominously warns that because they have overturned the natural world order, the animals will turn on them. The next evening Anatole finds an evil sign outside of his hut, and awakes the following morning to find a poisonous mamba snake curled up beside his bed."
The Poisonwood BibleBarbara Kingsolver,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/poisonwood/summary.html,"In the meantime, Leah is slowly falling in love with the schoolteacher Anatole, and falling out of love with her father and his simplistic view of right and wrong, while Adah is falling in love with the subtle language of Lingala. Rachel must pretend to be engaged to Eeben Axelroot to avoid a pity proposal of marriage from Chief Ndu, and she too finds her way into slight, and self- serving, infatuation. Ruth May falls ill with malaria, and when she recovers she is a pale, shadowy version of her old self."
The Poisonwood BibleBarbara Kingsolver,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/poisonwood/summary.html,"It does not take long for this faith to begin to waver. The first sign that they have miscalculated the superiority of their way of life comes when Nathan attempts to plant a vegetable garden. His ""demonstration garden"" is intended to both provide food for his family, and to instruct the natives in simple agricultural principles that might save them from malnutrition. However, though his garden grows lush and huge, none of his plants ever bear fruit. It takes him several weeks to realize that his plants cannot bear fruit here, because there are no African pollinators suited to North American vegetables. The next, and much larger, blow comes when their live-in helper, Mama Tataba becomes so enraged at Nathan's insistence on baptism for the villagers that she deserts them. As Mama Tataba explains in her final burst of anger, the villagers will never agree to being dunked in the river because a crocodile recently ate a young girl in that very river."

From Bulungu, Rachel is flown to Johannesburg, South Africa by Eeben Axelroot, Adah and Orleanna make their way to the Belgian embassy in Leopoldville, and then on to Georgia, and as Leah convalesces under Anatole's care she falls wholly in love and decides to remain in the Congo as his wife. Rachel goes on to marry three men, the last of whom leaves her a luxury hotel deep in the French Congo, which she spends the rest of her life happily running. Adah goes to medical school and becomes a successful epidemiologist, taking on science as her religion. Leah and Anatole have four sons and spend their lives working toward true independence and justice for African nations. Orleanna, finally, lives her life wracked with guilt, and begging for forgiveness from Ruth May. In the last section of the book, narrated by the dead Ruth May, this forgiveness is granted."

Nathan refuses his request, but the girls take pity on his whimpering and join him outside. Taking a cue from one of their father's sermons, they spread the ground with ash, hoping to catch the footprints of the person planting poisonous snakes in the homes of those connected to the Prices. The next morning, when they sneak out to the chicken coop, they see the six-toed footprints of Tata Kuvundu, as well as a green mamba snake lying in the corner. Nelson pokes the snake with a pole, and it slithers out the door and past them. However, on its way out, it bites Ruth May on the shoulder, and she dies before their eyes."

Her mother died when she was a young girl, and her father raised her in a haphazard manner, allowing her to educate herself and encouraging her independence. As a result, the adult Isabel is widely read, imaginative, confident in her own mind, and slightly narcissistic; she has the reputation in Albany for being a formidable intellect, and as a result she often seems intimidating to men. She has had few suitors, but one of them is Caspar Goodwood, the powerful, charismatic son of a wealthy Boston mill owner. Isabel is drawn to Caspar, but her commitment to her independence makes her fear him as well, for she feels that to marry him would be to sacrifice her freedom."

She has a child the year after they are married, but the boy dies six months after he is born. Three years into their marriage, Isabel and Osmond have come to despise one another; they live with Pansy in a palazzo in Rome, where Osmond treats Isabel as barely a member of the family: to him, she is a social hostess and a source of wealth, and he is annoyed by her independence and her insistence on having her own opinions. Isabel chafes against Osmond's arrogance, his selfishness, and his sinister desire to crush her individuality, but she does not consider leaving him. For all her commitment to her independence, Isabel is also committed to her social duty, and when she married Osmond, she did so with the intention of transforming herself into a good wife."
The Portrait of a LadyHenry James,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/portraitlady/summary.html,"After Ralph's death, Isabel struggles to decide whether to return to her husband or not. She promised Pansy that she would return to Rome, and her commitment to social propriety impels her to go back and honor her marriage. But her independent spirit urges her to flee from Osmond and find happiness elsewhere. Caspar Goodwood appears at the funeral, and afterwards, he asks Isabel to run away with him and forget about her husband. The next day, unable to find her, Goodwood asks Henrietta where she has gone.

Osmond's daughter Pansy is being brought up in a convent; his wife is dead. In secret, Osmond and Merle have a mysterious relationship; Merle is attempting to manipulate Isabel into marrying Osmond so that he will have access to her fortune.

But Osmond desperately wants to see Pansy married to Warburton. Isabel is torn about whether to fulfill her duty to her husband and help him arrange the match between Warburton and Pansy, or to fulfill the impulse of her conscience and discourage Warburton, while helping Pansy find a way to marry Rosier."

Now Isabel must struggle to decide whether to obey his command and remain true to her marriage vows or to disregard him and hurry to her cousin's bedside. Encouraging her to go, Osmond's sister, the Countess Gemini, tells her that there is still more to Merle and Osmond's relationship. Merle is Pansy's mother; Pansy was born out of wedlock. Osmond's wife died at about the same time, so Merle and Osmond spread the story that she died in childbirth. Pansy was placed in a convent to be raised, and she does not know that Merle is her real mother.

Isabel and Mrs. Touchett leave for England, where Mrs. Touchett's estranged husband is a powerful banker. Isabel makes a strong impression on everyone at Mr. Touchett's county manor of Gardencourt: her cousin Ralph, slowly dying of a lung disorder, becomes deeply devoted to her, and the Touchetts' aristocratic neighbor Lord Warburton falls in love with her. Warburton proposes, but Isabel declines; though she fears that she is passing up a great social opportunity by not marrying Warburton, she still believes that marriage would damage her treasured independence. As a result, she pledges to accomplish something wonderful with her life, something that will justify her decision to reject Warburton."

She is thrilled to have exercised her independence so forcefully. Mr. Touchett's health declines, and Ralph convinces him that when he dies, he should leave half his wealth to Isabel: this will protect her independence and ensure that she will never have to marry for money. Mr. Touchett agrees shortly before he dies. Isabel is left with a large fortune for the first time in her life.

The PrinceNiccolò Machiavelli,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/prince/summary.html,"The first two chapters describe the book’s scope. The
Prince is concerned with autocratic regimes, not with republican
regimes. The first chapter defines the various types of principalities
and princes; in doing so, it constructs an outline for the rest
of the book. Chapter III comprehensively describes how to maintain
composite principalities—that is, principalities that are newly
created or annexed from another power, so that the prince is not
familiar to the people he rules. Chapter III also introduces the
book’s main concerns—power politics, warcraft, and popular goodwill—in
an encapsulated form."
The PrinceNiccolò Machiavelli,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/prince/summary.html,"The final sections of The Prince link
the book to a specific historical context: Italy’s disunity. Machiavelli
sets down his account and explanation of the failure of past Italian
rulers and concludes with an impassioned plea to the future rulers
of the nation. Machiavelli asserts the belief that only Lorenzo
de’ Medici, to whom the book is dedicated, can restore Italy’s honor
and pride."
The PrinceNiccolò Machiavelli,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/prince/summary.html,"Chapters IV through XIV constitute the heart of the book. Machiavelli
offers practical advice on a variety of matters, including the advantages
and disadvantages that attend various routes to power, how to acquire
and hold new states, how to deal with internal insurrection, how
to make alliances, and how to maintain a strong military. Implicit
in these chapters are Machiavelli’s views regarding free will, human
nature, and ethics, but these ideas do not manifest themselves explicitly
as topics of discussion until later."
The PrinceNiccolò Machiavelli,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/prince/summary.html,"Chapters XV to XXIII focus on the qualities of the prince
himself. Broadly speaking, this discussion is guided by Machiavelli’s underlying
view that lofty ideals translate into bad government. This premise
is especially true with respect to personal virtue. Certain virtues
may be admired for their own sake, but for a prince to act in accordance
with virtue is often detrimental to the state. Similarly, certain
vices may be frowned upon, but vicious actions are sometimes indispensable
to the good of the state. Machiavelli combines this line of reasoning
with another: the theme that obtaining the goodwill of the populace
is the best way to maintain power. Thus, the appearance of
virtue may be more important than true virtue, which may be seen
as a liability."
The PrinceNiccolò Machiavelli,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/prince/summary.html,"Machiavelli composed The
Prince as a practical guide for ruling (though some scholars argue that the book was intended as a satire and essentially a guide on how not to rule). This goal is evident
from the very beginning, the dedication of the book to Lorenzo de’
Medici, the ruler of Florence. The Prince is not particularly
theoretical or abstract; its prose is simple and its logic straightforward.
These traits underscore Machiavelli’s desire to provide practical,
easily understandable advice."

Westley frightens Humperdinck with talk about how he would leave him alive but maimed if they were to duel, and the prince allows himself to be tied to a chair by Buttercup. Meanwhile, Fezzik, who has gotten lost on the grounds, appears with the prince's four white horses, and he, Inigo, Westley and Buttercup ride away. S.

with his family to the land of his own people. They pack up their
entire camp, and Jacob bargains with Laban for the flocks and possessions he
sees as rightfully his, having been overseer of Laban’s flocks for many
years. Rachel steals Laban’s household gods (which are icons or
figurines), as they are hers by birthright (since she is the being youngest
daughter). They set off for Canaan, and Dinah is awestruck by the
excitement of travel: she sees slaves, jugglers, and strange animals.
When they finally meet her uncle Esau and his family, the reunion
is a happy one. Dinah meets her cousin Tabea, who is the first girl
friend she makes of her own age. Esau offers to share his lands
with Jacob, but he refuses, and the family moves on to find space
enough to support Jacob’s many sons. They make camp at last, and
some of his sons take wives."
The Red-Headed LeagueArthur Conan Doyle,http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/the-red-headed-league/summary.html,"Later that night, Holmes tells Watson how he solved the case. Holmes realized from the beginning that the Red-Headed League was simply too preposterous to be real and that it must therefore have been a ploy to get Wilson out of his shop for a few hours every day. The fact that Spaulding was willing to work for so little money and spent a lot of time alone in the basement suggested to Holmes that Spaulding was doing something illicit in the cellar. When he noticed the bank nearby, Holmes had suspected that Spaulding was digging a tunnel to the bank. Holmes pounded on the sidewalk outside Wilson’s shop to determine whether the ground was hollow underneath, and he knocked on the door for directions so that he could see whether the knees of Spaulding’s pants were worn away. The fact that the league dissolved so suddenly suggested to Holmes that the robbery was imminent, and he was therefore able to make preparations and capture John Clay."

Wilson says that Spaulding is a fine worker, although he is interested in photography and often goes alone into the basement of the shop to develop photos. About two months ago, Spaulding drew Wilson’s attention to an advertisement in the paper for an opening in the League of Red-Headed Men. According to Spaulding, the league is a foundation established by an eccentric and wealthy American to promote the interests of redheaded men by paying them to perform small tasks. Spaulding encouraged Wilson to apply, and the two went to the offices listed in the advertisement. After fighting through a crowd of redheaded men waiting outside, Spaulding and Wilson made their way to the manager, another redheaded man by the name of Duncan Ross, who promptly hired Wilson. The league paid Wilson to copy pages of the Encyclopedia Britannica, forbidding him from leaving the office for any reason during his four-hour shifts."

Wilson went immediately to Sherlock Holmes, hoping that Holmes could help him find out whether he had been the victim of a practical joke. Holmes asks Wilson a few questions about Vincent Spaulding and discovers that Spaulding came to work for Wilson only about a month before the whole mysterious affair began.

The Remains of the DayKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/remains/summary.html,"The purpose of Stevens's road trip is to visit Miss Kenton, the former housekeeper of Darlington Hall who left twenty years earlier to get married. Stevens has received a letter from Miss Kenton, and believes that her letter hints that her marriage is failing and that she might like to return to her post as housekeeper. Ever since World War II has ended, it has been difficult to find enough people to staff large manor houses such as Darlington Hall."
The Remains of the DayKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/remains/summary.html,"The Remains of the Day is told in the first-person narration of an English butler named Stevens. In July 1956, Stevens decides to take a six- day road trip to the West Country of England—a region to the west of Darlington Hall, the house in which Stevens resides and has worked as a butler for thirty-four years. Though the house was previously owned by the now-deceased Lord Darlington, by 1956, it has come under the ownership of Mr. Farraday, an American gentleman. Stevens likes Mr. Farraday, but fails to interact well with him socially: Stevens is a circumspect, serious person and is not comfortable joking around in the manner Mr. Farraday prefers. Stevens terms this skill of casual conversation ""bantering""; several times throughout the novel Stevens proclaims his desire to improve his bantering skill so that he can better please his current employer."
The Remains of the DayKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/remains/summary.html,"Much of the narrative is comprised of Stevens's memories of his work as a butler during and just after World War II. He describes the large, elaborate dinner parties and elegant, prominent personages who come to dine and stay at Darlington Hall in those times. It is gradually revealed—largely through other characters' interactions with Stevens, rather than his own admissions—that Lord Darlington, due to his mistaken impression of the German agenda prior to World War II, sympathized with the Nazis. Darlington even arranged and hosted dinner parties between the German and British heads of state to help both sides come to a peaceful understanding. Stevens always maintains that Lord Darlington was a perfect gentleman, and that it is a shame his reputation has been soiled simply because he misunderstood the Nazis' true aims."
The Remains of the DayKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/remains/summary.html,"During the trip Stevens also recounts stories of his contemporaries—butlers in other houses with whom he struck up friendships. Stevens's most notable relationship by far, however, is his long-term working relationship with Miss Kenton. Though Stevens never says so outright, it appears that he harbors repressed romantic feelings for Miss Kenton. Despite the fact that the two frequently disagree over various household affairs when they work together, the disagreements are childish in nature and mainly serve to illustrate the fact that the two care for each other. At the end of the novel, Miss Kenton admits to Stevens that her life may have turned out better if she had married him. After hearing these words, Stevens is extremely upset. However, he does not tell Miss Kenton—whose married name is Mrs. Benn—how he feels. Stevens and Miss Kenton part, and Stevens returns to Darlington Hall, his only new resolve being to perfect the art of bantering to please his new employer."
The Remains of the DayKazuo Ishiguro,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/remains/summary.html,"As Salman Rushdie comments, The Remains of the Day is ""a story both beautiful and cruel."" It is a story primarily about regret: throughout his life, Stevens puts his absolute trust and devotion in a man who makes drastic mistakes. In the totality of his professional commitment, Stevens fails to pursue the one woman with whom he could have had a fulfilling and loving relationship. His prim mask of formality cuts him off from intimacy, companionship, and understanding."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"At the end of Book IV, Plato tries to show that individual
justice mirrors political justice. He claims that the soul of every
individual has a three part structure analagous to the three classes
of a society. There is a rational part of the soul, which seeks
after truth and is responsible for our philosophical inclinations;
a spirited part of the soul, which desires honor and is responsible
for our feelings of anger and indignation; and an appetitive part
of the soul, which lusts after all sorts of things, but money most
of all (since money must be used to fulfill any other base desire).
The just individual can be defined in analogy with the just society;
the three parts of his soul achieve the requisite relationships
of power and influence in regard to one another. In a just individual,
the rational part of the soul rules, the spirited part of the soul
supports this rule, and the appetitive part of the soul submits
and follows wherever reason leads. Put more plainly: in a just individual,
the entire soul aims at fulfilling the desires of the rational part,
much as in the just society the entire community aims at fulfilling
whatever the rulers will."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"Philosophers form the only class of men to possess knowledge and
are also the most just men. Their souls, more than others, aim to fulfil
the desires of the rational part. After comparing the philosopher
king to the most unjust type of man—represented by the tyrant, who
is ruled entirely by his non-rational appetites—Plato claims that
justice is worthwhile for its own sake. In Book IX he presents three
arguments for the conclusion that it is desirable to be just. By
sketching a psychological portrait of the tyrant, he attempts to
prove that injustice tortures a man’s psyche, whereas a just soul
is a healthy, happy one, untroubled and calm. Next he argues that, though
each of the three main character types—money-loving, honor-loving,
and truth-loving—have their own conceptions of pleasure and of the
corresponding good life—each choosing his own life as the most pleasant—only
the philosopher can judge because only he has experienced all three
types of pleasure. The others should accept the philosopher’s judgement
and conclude that the pleasures associated with the philosophical
are most pleasant and thus that the just life is also most pleasant.
He tries to demonstrate that only philosophical pleasure is really
pleasure at all; all other pleasure is nothing more than cessation
of pain."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"In a series of three analogies—the allegories of the
sun, the line, and the cave—Plato explains who these individuals
are while hammering out his theory of the Forms. Plato explains
that the world is divided into two realms, the visible (which we
grasp with our senses) and the intelligible (which we only grasp
with our mind). The visible world is the universe we see around
us. The intelligible world is comprised of the Forms—abstract, changeless
absolutes such as Goodness, Beauty, Redness, and Sweetness that
exist in permanent relation to the visible realm and make it possible.
(An apple is red and sweet, the theory goes, because it participates
in the Forms of Redness and Sweetness.) Only the Forms are objects
of knowledge, because only they possess the eternal unchanging truth
that the mind—not the senses—must apprehend."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"Plato’s strategy in The Republic is
to first explicate the primary notion of societal, or political,
justice, and then to derive an analogous concept of individual justice.
In Books II, III, and IV, Plato identifies political justice as
harmony in a structured political body. An ideal society consists
of three main classes of people—producers (craftsmen, farmers, artisans,
etc.), auxiliaries (warriors), and guardians (rulers); a society
is just when relations between these three classes are right. Each
group must perform its appropriate function, and only that function,
and each must be in the right position of power in relation to the
others. Rulers must rule, auxiliaries must uphold rulers’ convictions,
and producers must limit themselves to exercising whatever skills
nature granted them (farming, blacksmithing, painting, etc.) Justice
is a principle of specialization: a principle that requires that
each person fulfill the societal role to which nature fitted him
and not interfere in any other business."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"Only those whose minds are trained to grasp the Forms—the
philosophers—can know anything at all. In particular, what the philosophers
must know in order to become able rulers is the Form of the Good—the
source of all other Forms, and of knowledge, truth, and beauty.
Plato cannot describe this Form directly, but he claims that it is
to the intelligible realm what the sun is to the visible realm.
Using the allegory of the cave, Plato paints an evocative portrait
of the philosopher’s soul moving through various stages of cognition
(represented by the line) through the visible realm into
the intelligible, and finally grasping the Form of the Good. The
aim of education is not to put knowledge into the soul, but to put
the right desires into the soul—to fill the soul with a lust for
truth, so that it desires to move past the visible world, into the
intelligible, ultimately to the Form of the Good."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"The parallels between the just society and the just individual
run deep. Each of the three classes of society, in fact, is dominated
by one of the three parts of the soul. Producers are dominated by
their appetites—their urges for money, luxury, and pleasure. Warriors
are dominated by their spirits, which make them courageous. Rulers
are dominated by their rational faculties and strive for wisdom.
Books V through VII focus on the rulers as the philosopher kings."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"Plato ends The Republic on a surprising
note. Having defined justice and established it as the greatest
good, he banishes poets from his city. Poets, he claims, appeal
to the basest part of the soul by imitating unjust inclinations.
By encouraging us to indulge ignoble emotions in sympathy with the
characters we hear about, poetry encourages us to indulge these
emotions in life. Poetry, in sum, makes us unjust. In closing, Plato
relates the myth of Er, which describes the trajectory of a soul
after death. Just souls are rewarded for one thousand years,
while unjust ones are punished for the same amount of time. Each
soul then must choose its next life."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"One might notice that none of these arguments actually
prove that justice is desirable apart from its consequences—instead,
they establish that justice is always accompanied by true pleasure.
In all probability, none of these is actually supposed to serve
as the main reason why justice is desirable. Instead, the desirability
of justice is likely connected to the intimate relationship between
the just life and the Forms. The just life is good in and of itself
because it involves grasping these ultimate goods, and imitating
their order and harmony, thus incorporating them into one’s own
life. Justice is good, in other words, because it is connected to
the greatest good, the Form of the Good."
The RepublicPlato,http://www.sparknotes.com/philosophy/republic/summary.html,"Why do men behave justly? Is
it because they fear societal punishment? Are they trembling before notions
of divine retribution? Do the stronger elements of society scare
the weak into submission in the name of law? Or do men behave justly
because it is good for them to do so? Is justice, regardless of
its rewards and punishments, a good thing in and of itself? How
do we define justice? Plato sets out to answer these questions
in The Republic. He wants to define justice, and to
define it in such a way as to show that justice is worthwhile in
and of itself. He meets these two challenges with a single solution:
a definition of justice that appeals to human psychology, rather
than to perceived behavior."

Fearing the loss of the man she loves, Arkadina pleads, kisses, flatters, and begs on her hands and knees for Trigorin to leave with her. Her persuasive talk convinces Trigorin to leave, but, when Nina and he catch a few private moments before he leaves, Nina tells Trigorin her plan to move to Moscow at once and to try her luck at an acting career. Trigorin tells Nina to stay at the Slavyansky Bazaar Hotel. He asks her to let him know as soon as she gets there.

She asks him to give her two minutes more before he leaves. Trigorin discovers that inscribed on the medallion is a page and line number from his book.

Treplev props a chair against the door. Nina and Treplev admit to each other that they have sought each other. Nina's speech becomes fractured and confusing. She cuts off her own thoughts. She says she is ""the Seagull"" and compares herself to a homeless wanderer in a Turgenev story. She cries. She says she feels better because she has not cried in two years.

She concludes that what is important for an artist is not how successful you are but that you persevere. Nina becomes weaker. Treplev asks her to stay. Nina confesses to Treplev that she still profoundly loves Trigorin. She remembers the innocence and hope that she and Treplev felt the summer they put on their play. She recites lines from the play.

The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"Having brought the woman to adulthood, de Beauvoir analyzes the
various “situations,” or roles, the adult woman inhabits. The bourgeois
woman performs three major functions: wife, mother, and entertainer.
No matter how illustrious the woman’s household may be, these roles
inevitably lead to immanence, incompleteness, and profound frustration.
Even those who accept a less conventional place in society—as a
prostitute or courtesan, for example—must submit to imperatives
defined by the male. De Beauvoir also reflects on the trauma of
old age. When a woman loses her reproductive capacity, she loses
her primary purpose and therefore her identity. In the final chapter
of this section, “Woman’s Situation and Character,” de Beauvoir
reiterates the controversial claim that woman’s situation is not a
result of her character. Rather, her character is a result of her
situation. Her mediocrity, complacency, lack of accomplishment,
laziness, passivity—all these qualities are the consequences of
her subordination, not the cause."
The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"The Second Sex chronicles de Beauvoir’s
effort to locate the source of these profoundly imbalanced gender
roles. In Book I, entitled “Facts and Myths,” she asks how “female
humans” come to occupy a subordinate position in society. To answer
this question—and to better understand her own identity—de Beauvoir
first turns to biology, psychoanalysis, and historical materialism.
These disciplines reveal indisputable “essential” differences between
men and women but provide no justification for woman’s inferiority.
They all take woman’s inferior “destiny” for granted."
The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"De Beauvoir next discusses various mythical representations
of women and demonstrates how these myths have imprinted human consciousness,
often to the disservice of women. De Beauvoir hopes to debunk the
persistent myth of the “eternal feminine” by showing that it arose
from male discomfort with the fact of his own birth. Throughout
history, maternity has been both worshipped and reviled: the mother
both brings life and heralds death. These mysterious operations
get projected onto the woman, who is transformed into a symbol of
“life” and in the process is robbed of all individuality. To illustrate
the prevalence of these myths, de Beauvoir studies the portrayal
of women by five modern writers. In the end of this section, de
Beauvoir examines the impact of these myths on individual experience.
She concludes that the “eternal feminine” fiction is reinforced
by biology, psychoanalysis, history, and literature."
The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"In “Justifications,” de Beauvoir studies some of the ways
that women reinforce their own dependency. Narcissists, women in
love, and mystics all embrace their immanence by drowning selfhood
in an external object—whether it be the mirror, a lover, or God. Throughout
the book, de Beauvoir mentions such instances of females being complicit
in their Otherness, particularly with regard to marriage. The difficulty
of breaking free from “femininity”—of sacrificing security and comfort
for some ill-conceived notion of “equality”—induces many women to
accept the usual unfulfilling roles of wife and mother. From the
very beginning of her discussion, de Beauvoir identifies the economic
underpinnings of female subordination—and the economic roots of
woman’s liberation. Only in work can she achieve autonomy. If woman
can support herself, she can also achieve a form of liberation.
In the concluding chapters of The Second Sex, de
Beauvoir discusses the logistical hurdles woman faces in pursuing
this goal."
The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"De Beauvoir’s primary thesis is that men fundamentally
oppress women by characterizing them, on every level, as the Other,
defined exclusively in opposition to men. Man occupies the role
of the self, or subject; woman is the object, the other. He is essential,
absolute, and transcendent. She is inessential, incomplete, and
mutilated. He extends out into the world to impose his will on it,
whereas woman is doomed to immanence, or inwardness. He creates,
acts, invents; she waits for him to save her. This distinction is
the basis of all de Beauvoir’s later arguments."
The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"Revolutionary and incendiary, The Second Sex is
one of the earliest attempts to confront human history from a feminist
perspective. It won de Beauvoir many admirers and just as many detractors. Today,
many regard this massive and meticulously researched masterwork
as not only as pillar of feminist thought but of twentieth-century
philosophy in general."
The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"She then moves to history to trace the emergence of male
superiority in society, from nomadic hunter-gatherers through the
French Revolution and contemporary times. Here she finds ample examples
of female subordination, but again, no persuasive justification for
them. History, she argues, is not an immutable “fact,” but a reflection
of certain attitudes, preconceptions, and injustices."
The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"De Beauvoir insists on the impossibility of comparing
the “character” of men and women without considering the immense
differences in their situation, and in Book II, entitled “Woman’s
Life Today,” she turns to the concrete realities of this situation.
She traces female development through its formative stages: childhood, youth,
and sexual initiation. Her goal is to prove that women are not born “feminine”
but shaped by a thousand external processes. She shows how, at each
stage of her upbringing, a girl is conditioned into accepting passivity,
dependence, repetition, and inwardness. Every force in society conspires
to deprive her of subjectivity and flatten her into an object. Denied
the possibility of independent work or creative fulfillment, the
woman must accept a dissatisfying life of housework, childbearing,
and sexual slavishness."
The Second SexSimone de Beauvoir,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secondsex/summary.html,"De Beauvoir states that while it is natural for humans
to understand themselves in opposition to others, this process is
flawed when applied to the genders. In defining woman exclusively
as Other, man is effectively denying her humanity."
The Secret GardenFrances Hodgson Burnett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/summary.html,"The Secret Garden opens by introducing us to Mary Lennox, a sickly, foul-tempered, unsightly little girl who loves no one and whom no one loves. At the outset of the story, she is living in India with her parents—a dashing army captain and his frivolous, beautiful wife—but is rarely permitted to see them. They have placed her under the constant care of a number of native servants, as they find her too hideous and tiresome to look after. Mary's circumstances are cast into complete upheaval when an outbreak of cholera devastates the Lennox household, leaving no one alive but herself."
The Secret GardenFrances Hodgson Burnett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/summary.html,"Mary becomes intensely curious about the secret garden, and determines to find it. This curiosity, along with the vigorous exercise she takes on the moor, begins to have an extremely positive effect upon Mary. She almost immediately becomes less sickly, more engaged with the world, and less foul-tempered. This change is aided by Ben Weatherstaff, a brusque but kindly old gardener, and a robin redbreast who lives in the secret garden. She begins to count these two ""people,"" along with Martha, Dickon Sowerby, and Susan Sowerby, as the friends she has had in her life. Her curiosity is whetted when she hears strange, far-off cries coming from one of the manor's distant rooms."
The Secret GardenFrances Hodgson Burnett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/summary.html,"Dickon and Mary secretly begin bringing Colin out into the secret garden. On the first of these outings, the children are discovered by Ben Weatherstaff, who has been covertly tending the secret garden once a year for ten years. Ben has done so out of love and loyalty for the late Mistress Craven: he was a favorite of hers. Weatherstaff refers to Colin as ""the poor cripple,"" and asks if he has crooked legs and a crooked back. Colin, made furious by this question, forces himself to stand up on his own feet for the first time in his life. After this feat, Colin's health improves miraculously: the secret garden, the springtime, and Dickon's company have the same rejuvenating effect upon him that they did upon Mary. The children determine to keep Colin's improvement a secret, however, so that he can surprise his father with his recovery when Master Craven returns from his trip abroad."
The Secret GardenFrances Hodgson Burnett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/summary.html,"One night, Mary hears the distant cries and, flagrantly disobeying Mrs. Medlock's prohibition, goes off in search of their source. She finds Colin Craven, Master Craven's invalid son, shut up in an opulent bedchamber. Colin was born shortly before his mother's death, and his father cannot bear to look at him because the boy painfully reminds him of his late wife. Colin has been bedridden since his birth, and it is believed that he will become a hunchback and die an early death. His servants have been commanded to obey his every whim, and Colin has become fantastically spoiled and imperious as a result. Colin and Mary strike up a friendship, but Colin becomes furious when she fails to visit him because she prefers to garden with Dickon. That night, Colin throws one of the infamous tantrums. Mary rushes to his room in a fury and commands him to stop crying. He tells her that his back is beginning to show a hunch; when Mary examines him, she finds nothing whatever the matter with him. Henceforth, she will maintain that Colin's illness is only in his mind: he will be well if only he makes up his mind to be."
The Secret GardenFrances Hodgson Burnett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/summary.html,"However, Mrs. Medlock, the head of the servants at Misselthwaite, absolutely forbids her to seek out the source of the cries. She is distracted from this mystery when she discovers, with the robin's help, the key to the secret garden. She immediately sets about working there, so that the neglected plants might thrive. Dickon, who brings her a set of gardening tools and promises to help her bring the secret garden back to life, vastly aids her in her endeavor. Dickon is a boy who can charm the animals of the moor ""the way snake charmers charm snakes in India."" He is only a common moor boy, but he is filled with so much uncanny wisdom that Mary comes to refer to him as ""the Yorkshire angel."""
The Secret GardenFrances Hodgson Burnett,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/secretgarden/summary.html,"The three children, along with Ben Weatherstaff, spend every day of the summer in the secret garden. Only one other person is admitted into the secret: Susan Sowerby, Dickon's saintly mother. Susan sends a letter to Master Craven, telling him to hurry home so that he might see his son; she does not, however, specify why, in deference to Colin's secret. Master Craven complies, and returns immediately to Misselthwaite. His first act is to go into the secret garden; he does so at the behest of a dream in which the voice of his late wife told him that he might find her there. Just as he lays his hand to the doorknob, Colin comes rushing out and falls into his arms. Father and son are reconciled, and the miracle of Colin's recovery becomes known to all."

A man whom everyone describes as ""a miserable hunchback,"" Master Craven has been in a state of inconsolable grief ever since the death of his wife ten years before the novel begins. Shortly after arriving at Misselthwaite, Mary hears about a secret garden from Martha Sowerby, her good-natured Yorkshire maidservant.

The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"Caddy’s pregnancy leaves Quentin emotionally shattered.
He attempts to claim false responsibility for the pregnancy, lying
to his father that he and Caddy have committed incest. Mr. Compson
is indifferent to Caddy’s promiscuity, dismissing Quentin’s story
and telling his son to leave early for the Northeast."
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"The Sound and the Fury literally begins
as a “tale / Told by an idiot,” as the first chapter is narrated
by the mentally disabled Benjy. The novel’s central concerns include
time, much like Macbeth’s “[t]omorrow, and tomorrow”; death, recalling
Macbeth’s “dusty death”; and nothingness and disintegration, a clear
reference to Macbeth’s lament that life “[s]ignif[ies] nothing.”
Additionally, Quentin is haunted by the sense that the Compson family
has disintegrated to a mere shadow of its former greatness."
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"In his soliloquy, Macbeth implies that life is but a
shadow of the past and that a modern man, like himself, is inadequately
equipped and unable to achieve anything near the greatness of the
past. Faulkner reinterprets this idea, implying that if man does
not choose to take his own life, as Quentin does, the only alternatives
are to become either a cynic and materialist like Jason, or an idiot
like Benjy, unable to see life as anything more than a meaningless
series of images, sounds, and memories."
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"The first three chapters of the novel consist of the
convoluted thoughts, voices, and memories of the three Compson brothers, captured
on three different days. The brothers are Benjy, a severely retarded
thirty-three-year-old man, speaking in April, 1928;
Quentin, a young Harvard student, speaking in June, 1910;
and Jason, a bitter farm-supply store worker, speaking again in
April, 1928. Faulkner tells the fourth chapter
in his own narrative voice, but focuses on Dilsey, the Compson family’s
devoted “Negro” cook who has played a great part in raising the
children. Faulkner harnesses the brothers’ memories of their sister
Caddy, using a single symbolic moment to forecast the decline of
the once prominent Compson family and to examine the deterioration
of the Southern aristocratic class since the Civil War."
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"The Compsons are one of several prominent names in the
town of Jefferson, Mississippi. Their ancestors helped settle the
area and subsequently defended it during the Civil War. Since the
war, the Compsons have gradually seen their wealth, land, and status
crumble away. Mr. Compson is an alcoholic. Mrs. Compson is a self-absorbed
hypochondriac who depends almost entirely upon Dilsey to raise her
four children. Quentin, the oldest child, is a sensitive bundle
of neuroses. Caddy is stubborn, but loving and compassionate. Jason
has been difficult and mean-spirited since birth and is largely
spurned by the other children. Benjy is severely mentally disabled,
an “idiot” with no understanding of the concepts of time or morality.
In the absence of the self-absorbed Mrs. Compson, Caddy serves as
a mother figure and symbol of affection for Benjy and Quentin."
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"As the children grow older, however, Caddy begins to
behave promiscuously, which torments Quentin and sends Benjy into
fits of moaning and crying. Quentin is preparing to go to Harvard,
and Mr. Compson sells a large portion of the family land to provide funds
for the tuition. Caddy loses her virginity and becomes pregnant.
She is unable or unwilling to name the father of the child, though
it is likely Dalton Ames, a boy from town."
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"Attempting to apply traditional
plot summary to The Sound and the Fury is difficult.
At a basic level, the novel is about the three Compson brothers’
obsessions with the their sister Caddy, but this brief synopsis
represents merely the surface of what the novel contains. A story told
in four chapters, by four different voices, and out of chronological
order, The Sound and the Fury requires intense
concentration and patience to interpret and understand."
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"The title of The Sound and the Fury refers
to a line from William Shakespeare’s Macbeth. Macbeth,
a Scottish general and nobleman, learns of his wife’s suicide and
feels that his life is crumbling into chaos. In addition to Faulkner’s
title, we can find several of the novel’s important motifs in Macbeth’s
short soliloquy in Act V, scene v:"
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"Attempting to cover up her indiscretions, Caddy quickly
marries Herbert Head, a banker she met in Indiana. Herbert promises
Jason Compson a job in his bank. Herbert immediately divorces Caddy and
rescinds Jason’s job offer when he realizes his wife is pregnant with
another man’s child. Meanwhile, Quentin, still mired in despair
over Caddy’s sin, commits suicide by drowning himself in the Charles
River just before the end of his first year at Harvard."

promiscuous girl, constantly in conflict with her overbearing and vicious
uncle Jason. On Easter Sunday, 1928, Miss
Quentin steals several thousand dollars from Jason and runs away
with a man from a traveling show. While Jason chases after Miss
Quentin to no avail, Dilsey takes Benjy and the rest of her family
to Easter services at the local church."
The Sound and the FuryWilliam Faulkner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/soundfury/summary.html,"The Compsons disown Caddy from the family, but take in
her newborn daughter, Miss Quentin. The task of raising Miss Quentin falls
squarely on Dilsey’s shoulders. Mr. Compson dies of alcoholism roughly
a year after Quentin’s suicide. As the oldest surviving son, Jason
becomes the head of the Compson household. Bitterly employed at
a menial job in the local farm-supply store, Jason devises an ingenious

now heading north as well. Rowlandson is again separated from her family and
acquaintances. After a four-day rest in the forest, the band of Indians with whom
Rowlandson is traveling begins to travel more swiftly. Rowlandson suspects that the
British army must be close. They reach the Baquaug River and cross it, and the
English arrive close behind. The British soldiers, however, are unable to ford the
river, and the Indians and Rowlandson continue to the northwest. Rowlandson and her
captors soon reach the Connecticut River, which they plan to cross in order to meet
with King Philip. Here, however, are English scouts, and the Indians and Rowlandson
are forced to scatter in the forest to remain undetected. Rowlandson again meets up
with her son and his captors, though they must soon part ways."

other side, she meets with King Philip as planned. For some time, she remains at
this settlement, sewing clothes for the Indians in return for food. The Indians,
meanwhile, raid Northampton and return with spoils, including horses. Rowlandson
asks to be taken to Albany on horseback, hoping that there she will be “sold” in
exchange for gunpowder, but instead, the Indians prepare to take her northward and
over the river once more."

Rowlandson’s captors once again bring her north but then turn south again.
Rowlandson hopes she’ll be returned home, but the Indians delay the journey,
continuing south down the Connecticut River rather than turning east toward
civilization. Indian attacks on British towns continue, and another captive, Thomas
Read, joins Rowlandson’s group. From Read, Rowlandson learns that her husband is
alive and well, which heartens her. Rowlandson also sees her son again, briefly.
Rowlandson and her captors finally begin to move east."
The Sovereignty and Goodness of GodMary Rowlandson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sovereignty/summary.html,"They again cross the Baquaug River. Messengers meet them and report that
Rowlandson must go to Wachuset, where the Indians will meet to discuss her possible
return to freedom. More hopeful than she has been in some time, Rowlandson eagerly
sets off toward the council’s meeting place. But the journey tires her, and she is
disheartened by the sight of an injured colonist, wounded in still another Indian
attack. At Wachuset, she speaks with King Philip, who promises her she’ll be free in
two weeks. Nonetheless, the council continues to deliberate, asking Rowlandson how
much her husband would be willing to pay them as ransom. The Indians then send a
letter to Boston, stating that Rowlandson can be redeemed for twenty pounds.

The Sovereignty and Goodness of GodMary Rowlandson,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sovereignty/summary.html,"On the morning of February 10, 1675, the British settlement of Lancaster, in
the Massachusetts Bay Colony, is besieged by Native Americans. The attackers burn
down houses and open fire on the settlers, wounding and killing several of them, and
take a number of the survivors captive. Mary Rowlandson is one of the wounded, as is
her youngest child, Sarah. Other members of Rowlandson’s family are killed outright.
As the melee dies down, the Native Americans begin to lead their captives, including
Rowlandson and her three children, from the settlement into the surrounding
wilderness. At this point, Rowlandson and her two elder children are separated, but
she and the youngest are allowed to remain together."

in fear of Indian attack, the captors and their captives begin to trek westward,
farther into the forest. As Rowlandson and her daughter are both wounded, the
journey is difficult and painful. After another day of travel, they reach an Indian
settlement called Wenimesset. Here, Rowlandson meets another British captive, Robert
Pepper, who wants to offer the new captives comfort. The Indians and their captives
remain in Wenimesset for over a week, and during this time, Rowlandson’s wounded
child becomes more ill, finally dying on February 18. By this time, Rowlandson’s
original captor has sold her to a Saggamore Indian named Quannopin, who is related
by marriage to King Philip. Quannopin oversees the burial of Rowlandson’s dead
child, and a grieving Rowlandson visits her elder daughter (also named Mary), who
she learns is also being held in Wenimesset. As she despairs over the fate of her
family, her son visits her—he has been allowed to come from the nearby Indian
settlement where he is being held in captivity. Meanwhile, the Indians continue to
attack British towns, including Medfield, killing and looting as they go. Her
captors give Rowlandson a Bible, part of the spoils of Medfield, and in it she finds
comfort and hope."

herself to smile during the visit, and she expresses hope that Meursault
will be acquitted and that they will get married. As he awaits his
trial, Meursault slowly adapts to prison life. His isolation from
nature, women, and cigarettes torments him at first, but he eventually adjusts
to living without them, and soon does not even notice their absence.
He manages to keep his mind occupied, and he sleeps for most of
each day."

Mike that night, but the couple does not show up. Bill and Jake
decide to leave for a small town called Burguete to fish, but Cohn
chooses to stay and wait for Brett. Bill and Jake travel to the
Spanish countryside and check into a small, rural inn. They spend
five pleasant days fishing, drinking, and playing cards. Eventually,
Jake receives a letter from Mike. He writes that he and Brett will
be arriving in Pamplona shortly. Jake and Bill leave on a bus that
afternoon to meet the couple. After arriving in Pamplona, Jake and
Bill check into a hotel owned by Montoya, a Spanish bullfighting
expert who likes Jake for his earnest interest in the sport. Jake
and Bill meet up with Brett, Mike, and Cohn, and the whole group

The city is consumed with dancing, drinking, and general debauchery.
The highlight of the first day is the first bullfight, at which
Pedro Romero, a nineteen-year-old prodigy, distinguishes himself
above all the other bullfighters. Despite its violence, Brett cannot
take her eyes off the bullfight, or Romero. A few days later, Jake
and his friends are at the hotel dining room, and Brett notices
Romero at a nearby table. She persuades Jake to introduce her to
him. Mike again verbally abuses Cohn, and they almost come to blows

boards an overnight train that same day. Jake finds Brett alone
in a Madrid hotel room. She has broken with Romero, fearing that
she would ruin him and his career. She announces that she now wants

with the narrator, Jake Barnes, delivering a brief biographical
sketch of his friend, Robert Cohn. Jake is a veteran of World War
I who now works as a journalist in Paris. Cohn is also an American expatriate,
although not a war veteran. He is a rich Jewish writer who lives
in Paris with his forceful and controlling girlfriend, Frances Clyne.
Cohn has become restless of late, and he comes to Jake’s office
one afternoon to try to convince Jake to go with him to South America.
Jake refuses, and he takes pains to get rid of Cohn. That night
at a dance club, Jake runs into Lady Brett Ashley, a divorced socialite
and the love of Jake’s life. Brett is a free-spirited and independent
woman, but she can be very selfish at times. She and Jake met in
England during World War I, when Brett treated Jake for a war wound.
During Jake and Brett’s conversation, it is subtly implied that
Jake’s injury rendered him impotent. Although Brett loves Jake,
she hints that she is unwilling to give up sex, and that for this
reason she will not commit to a relationship with him."

The Things They Carried,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/thingscarried/summary.html,"In the last story, “The Lives of the Dead,” O’Brien gives
another twist to his contention that stories have the power to save
people. In the stories of Curt Lemon and Kiowa, O’Brien explains
that his imagination allowed him to grapple successfully with his
guilt and confusion over the death of his fourth-grade first love,
Linda."
The Things They Carried,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/thingscarried/summary.html,"The protagonist, who
is named Tim O’Brien, begins by describing an event that occurred
in the middle of his Vietnam experience. “The Things They Carried”
catalogs the variety of things his fellow soldiers in the Alpha Company
brought on their missions. Several of these things are intangible,
including guilt and fear, while others are specific physical objects,
including matches, morphine, M-16 rifles, and
M&M’s candy."
The Things They Carried,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/thingscarried/summary.html,"Like “Love” and “Notes,” several of O’Brien’s stories
are told from a perspective twenty years after the Vietnam War,
when he is a forty-three-year-old writer living in Massachusetts.
Exposure to the guilt of old friends like Jimmy Cross and Norman
Bowker prompts him to write stories in order to understand what
they were going through. But two stories, “The Man I Killed” and
“Ambush,” are written so that O’Brien can confront his own guilt
over killing a man with a grenade outside the village of My Khe.
In “The Man I Killed,” O’Brien imagines the life of his victim,
from his childhood to the way things would have turned out for him
had O’Brien not spotted him on a path and thrown a grenade at his
feet. In “Ambush,” O’Brien imagines how he might relay the story
of the man he killed to his nine-year-old daughter, Kathleen. In
this second story, O’Brien provides more details of the actual killing—including the
sound of the grenade and his own feelings—and explains that even
well after the fact, he hasn’t finished sorting out the experience."
The Things They Carried,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/thingscarried/summary.html,"In “On the Rainy River,” the narrator, O’Brien, explains
the series of events that led him to Vietnam in the first place.
He receives his draft notice in June of 1968,
and his feelings of confusion drive him north to the Canadian border,
which he contemplates crossing so that he will not be forced to
fight in a war in which he doesn’t believe. Sitting in a rowboat
with the proprietor of the Tip Top Lodge, where he stays, O’Brien
decides that his guilt about avoiding the war and fear of disappointing
his family are more important than his political convictions. He
soon leaves, going first back home to Worthington, Minnesota and
later to Vietnam."
The Things They Carried,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/thingscarried/summary.html,"The death that receives the most attention in The
Things They Carried is that of Kiowa, a much-loved member
of the Alpha Company and one of O’Brien’s closest friends. In “Speaking
of Courage,” the story of Kiowa’s death is relayed in retrospect
through the memory of Norman Bowker, years after the war. As Bowker
drives around a lake in his Iowa hometown, he thinks that he failed
to save Kiowa, who was killed when a mortar round hit and caused
him to sink headfirst into a marshy field. O’Brien realizes that
he has dealt with his guilt over Kiowa’s death differently than
Norman Bowker in “Notes.” Just before the end of the war, O’Brien
receives a long letter from Bowker that says he hasn’t found a way
to make life meaningful after the war. O’Brien resolves to tell
Bowker’s story, and the story of Kiowa’s death, in order to negotiate
his own feelings of guilt and hollowness."
The Things They Carried,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/thingscarried/summary.html,"Throughout the collection, the same characters reappear
in various stories. The first member of the Alpha Company to die
is Ted Lavender, a “grunt,” or low-ranking soldier, who deals with
his anxiety about the war by taking tranquilizers and smoking marijuana.
Lavender is shot in the head on his way back from going to the bathroom,
and his superior, Lieutenant Jimmy Cross, blames himself for the
tragedy. When Lavender is shot, Cross is distracting himself with
thoughts of Martha, a college crush. It is revealed in “Love” that
Cross’s feelings for Martha, whom he dated once before leaving for
Vietnam, were never reciprocated, and that even twenty years after
the war, his guilt over Lavender’s death remains."
The Things They Carried,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/thingscarried/summary.html,"In addition to Ted Lavender, a few other members of the
Alpha Company are killed during their mission overseas, including
Curt Lemon, who is killed when he steps on a rigged mortar round. Though O’Brien is not close to Lemon, in “The Dentist,”
he tells a story of how Lemon, who faints before a routine checkup
with an army-issued dentist, tries to save face by insisting that
a perfectly good tooth be pulled. Lee Strunk, another member of
the company, dies from injuries he sustains by stepping on a landmine.
In “Friends,” O’Brien remembers that before Strunk was fatally hurt,
Strunk and Dave Jensen had made a pact that if either man were irreparably
harmed, the other man would see that he was quickly killed. However,
when Strunk is actually hurt, he begs Jensen to spare him, and Jensen
complies. Instead of being upset by the news of his friend’s swift
death en route to treatment, Jensen is relieved."
The Three MusketeersAlexandre Dumas,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/3musk/summary.html,The Three Musketeers is a marvelous journey and should be appreciated foremost for its engaging story. The techniques Dumas employed to such success in 1840-- particularly his mastery of the form of the Romance--still work today.
The Three MusketeersAlexandre Dumas,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/3musk/summary.html,"With Dumas’s historical context in mind, the melancholy of the Romance becomes even more pronounced. It is almost as though Dumas presents this wonderful Romantic adventure, providing people with a chance to escape day to day toil and immerse themselves in better thoughts about their country, and then spurns it. He cannot bring himself to see the lie of Romanticism through to the end. Even bearing in mind that this turn to ambiguity is typical for the end of the Romance, it is hard not to interpret the ending of the novel as Dumas’s rejection of Romantic values."
The Three MusketeersAlexandre Dumas,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/3musk/summary.html,"But The Three Musketeers is not merely a Romance; it is also a great historical novel, and Dumas’s interesting approach to history also contributes to the success of his book. While he keeps his characters away from being major players in national events, he is not afraid of brazenly attributing human motives to history. In Dumas’s version, France and England very nearly fight a war simply because the Duke of Buckingham loves Anne of Austria: John Fenton assassinates Buckingham because of personal reasons provided by Milady, and so on. Part of the entertainment of The Three Musketeers is that, in seeming to avoid the great events and focus on petty affairs, Dumas explains the great events more satisfyingly and entertainingly than any direct explanation of affairs of state could hope to do. History does not have a face-- d'Artagnan has a face, and a handsome one at that."
The Three MusketeersAlexandre Dumas,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/3musk/summary.html,"As we saw in the closing portions of the book, Dumas gives us a fully developed Romance within his historical framework. He starts with levity and confidence, and ends with moroseness and doubt. The ending, indeed, seems to question many of the books dearly held values. D'Artagnan becomes a lieutenant in the Musketeers, but his promotion comes from the Cardinal--the Cardinal whom he and his four friends had fought so valiantly against for the first half of the novel. In the epilogue, d'Artagnan befriends the Comte de Rochefort, a Cardinalist agent. Was all that earlier fighting really worth it, then? Or was there something futile in all the Musketeers' efforts? Both the possibility of futility and this return to the normal at the end of a great Quest, characterize the form of the Romance as much as do its lighter aspects. Dumas sees the form through."
The Three MusketeersAlexandre Dumas,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/3musk/summary.html,"There are two sequels to The Three Musketeers, which Dumas wrote to capitalize on the success of the novel. They are entitled Vingt ans apres, published in 10 volumes in 1845, and Dix ans plus tard, ou le vicomte de Bragelonne, published in 26 parts from 1848-1850. The latter opens in 1660, and tells of a matured, powerful d'Artagnan, captain of the Musketeers. It also contains the account of Porthos's heroic death. But despite these sequels, Dumas never fully recaptured his success of 1844. His estate and his health declined until, after a period of furious attempted productivity to recoup his debts, he died in 1870. The Romance left his life as well."
The Three MusketeersAlexandre Dumas,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/3musk/summary.html,"Dumas’s formula serves his story well. His incorporation of Romanticism into the historical novel lifted an entire genre of literature into public adulation, and gave the French people a story that reassured them about their country even as it brought them away from their country's troubles. Popular literature must be considered on two fronts: aesthetically and socially, as literature and as a popular artifact. The best popular literature, like the work of Alexandre Dumas, supercedes the latter category to come into our minds as a work of literature in its own right. It is not necessary to know about Dumas’s life, or about French history, or about the genre of Romance, to enjoy The Three Musketeers. The superlative entertainment of the novel speaks for itself--which is why it remains so important and so interesting to study it."
The Time MachineH. G. Wells,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/timemachine/summary.html,"A group of men, including the narrator, is listening to the Time Traveller discuss his theory that time is the fourth dimension. The Time Traveller produces a miniature time machine and makes it disappear into thin air. The next week, the guests return, to find their host stumble in, looking disheveled and tired. They sit down after dinner, and the Time Traveller begins his story."
The Time MachineH. G. Wells,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/timemachine/summary.html,"The Time Traveller had finally finished work on his time machine, and it rocketed him into the future. When the machine stops, in the year 802,701 AD, he finds himself in a paradisiacal world of small humanoid creatures called Eloi. They are frail and peaceful, and give him fruit to eat. He explores the area, but when he returns he finds that his time machine is gone. He decides that it has been put inside the pedestal of a nearby statue. He tries to pry it open but cannot. In the night, he begins to catch glimpses of strange white ape-like creatures the Eloi call Morlocks. He decides that the Morlocks live below ground, down the wells that dot the landscape. Meanwhile, he saves one of the Eloi from drowning, and she befriends him. Her name is Weena. The Time Traveller finally works up enough courage to go down into the world of Morlocks to try to retrieve his time machine. He finds that matches are a good defense against the Morlocks, but ultimately they chase him out of their realm. Frightened by the Morlocks, he takes Weena to try to find a place where they will be safe from the Morlocks' nocturnal hunting. He goes to what he calls the Palace of Green Porcelain, which turns out to be a museum. There, he finds more matches, some camphor, and a lever he can use as a weapon. That night, retreating from the Morlocks through a giant wood, he accidentally starts a fire. Many Morlocks die in the fire and the battle that ensues, and Weena is killed. The exhausted Time Traveller returns to the pedestal to find that it has already been pried open. He strides in confidently, and just when the Morlocks think that they have trapped him, he springs onto the machine and whizzes into the future."
The Time MachineH. G. Wells,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/timemachine/summary.html,"The Time Traveller makes several more stops. In a distant time he stops on a beach where he is attacked by giant crabs. The bloated red sun sits motionless in the sky. He then travels thirty million years into the future. The air is very thin, and the only sign of life is a black blob with tentacles. He sees a planet eclipse the sun. He then returns, exhausted, to the present time. The next day, he leaves again, but never returns."
The TrialFranz Kafka,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/trial/summary.html,"How to summarize this kind of text? It was written during 1914-1915, while Kafka was an official in the Workmen's Accident Insurance Institute for the Kingdom of Bohemia. On one level we can see in The Trial a satirical pillorying of the Austro-Hungarian bureaucracy of Kafka's day. Yet to many readers it is eerily prescient of the psychological weaponry used by the much more insidious totalitarian regimes to come, of the legally-sanctioned death machines Kafka never lived to see. It is also an unfinished novel, and this is apparent in the final chapters. It is at times as suffocating to read as the airless rooms of the Court that it describes. The German title, Der Prozess, connotes both a ""trial"" and a ""process,"" and it is perhaps this maddening feeling of inevitability that leaves a lasting visceral impression: the machinery has been set in motion, and the process will grind toward conclusion despite our most desperate exhortations."
The TrialFranz Kafka,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/trial/summary.html,"An ambitious, worldly young bank official named Joseph K. is arrested by two warders ""one fine morning,"" although he has done nothing wrong. K. is indignant and outraged. The morning happens to be that of his thirtieth birthday. One year later, on the morning of his thirty-first birthday, two warders again come for K. They take him to a quarry outside of town and kill him in the name of the Law. K. lets them."
The TrialFranz Kafka,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/trial/summary.html,"The Trial is the chronicle of that intervening year of K.'s case, his struggles and encounters with the invisible Law and the untouchable Court. It is an account, ultimately, of state-induced self-destruction. Yet, as in all of Kafka's best writing, the ""meaning"" is far from clear. Just as the parable related by the chaplain in Chapter Nine (called ""The Doorkeeper"" or ""Before the Law"") elicits endless commentary from students of the Law, so has The Trial been a touchstone of twentieth-century critical interpretation. As some commentators have noted, it has, in parts, the quality of revealed truth; as such it is ultimately unresolvable--a mirror for any sectarian reading."

nights. One night, she sees the ghost of Miss Jessel sitting on
the bottom stair, her head in her hands. Later, when the governess
finally allows herself to go to sleep at her regular hour, she is
awoken after midnight to find her candle extinguished and Flora
by the window. Careful not to disturb Flora, the governess leaves
the room to find a window downstairs that overlooks the same view.
Looking out, she sees the faraway figure of Miles on the lawn."

Peter Quint and looks out the window in vain. He cries out, then

Valentine is off to improve himself, venturing out to see the world, while Proteus stays home in Verona, tied by his love for Julia. After Valentine departs, his servant, Speed, enters. Proteus inquires whether or not Speed delivered a letter to Julia, to which Speed replies affirmatively. Julia, meanwhile, asks her maid, Lucetta, with which man she should fall in love, and Lucetta recommends Proteus. Lucetta admits that she has a letter for Julia from Proteus. After much bickering, Julia tears up the letter, only to regret this act an instant later."

When Proteus arrives at court, he too falls in love with Silvia, and vows to do anything he can to win her away from Valentine. When Valentine confesses that he and Silvia plan to elope, Proteus notifies the Duke of their plans, gaining favor for himself and effecting Valentine's banishment from court.

The Unbearable Lightness of BeingMilan Kundera,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/unbearablelightness/summary.html,"The Unbearable Lightness of Being opens with a philosophical discussion of lightness versus heaviness. Kundera contrasts Nietzsche's philosophy of eternal return, or of heaviness, with Parmenides's understanding of life as light. Kundera wonders if any meaning or weight can be attributed to life, since there is no eternal return: if man only has the opportunity to try one path, to make one decision, he cannot return to take a different path, and then compare the two lives. Without the ability to co mpare lives, Kundera argues, we cannot find meaning; where meaning should exist we find only an unbearable weightlessness. The uncertain existence of meaning, and the opposition of lightness and heaviness, the key dichotomy of The Unbearable Lightness of Being, sets the stage for the entire novel."

With Bayard and Ringo, she sets off for Alabama and the Union army. They pass an army of freed slaves that is also seeking out the Yankees. On the way, they stop at Hawkhurst, where Bayard's Aunt Louisa lives; Ringo is excited to see the railroad that runs nearby. But the railroad has been destroyed and the house burned. At Hawkhurst, Bayard's cousin Drusilla begs him to ask his father to let her join the regiment as a soldier. She accompanies them to the river crossing where the Yankees are encamped, and they are engulfed in a sea of restless slaves. The Northern troops dynamite the bridge over the river, and in the confusion the wagon falls into the water. The Yankees retrieve them, however, and are so overburdened with excess slaves that Colonel Dick issues Granny an order for more than 100 slaves and mules, as well as for several chests of silver. Granny dismisses most of the slaves, but she and Ringo use the order to get twelve extra horses from a Union encampment."

However, she has planned the wedding for the same day as a hotly contested election in Jefferson, in which Colonel Sartoris is attempting to stop a carpetbagger victory in the town.

After the funeral, Bayard sets off to seek revenge, accompanied by Ringo and a friend of his father's, Uncle Buck. Realizing that Ab Snopes has joined Grumby's party, they track them for two months throughout the area. They know they are getting closer when a well-dressed stranger who turns out to be one of Grumby's men shoots at them, wounding Uncle Buck; the next day they find Ab Snopes tied up in the road as a kind of sacrifice. The cowardly Ab begs for mercy, and they decide not to kill him; instead, Uncle Buck carries him back to town.

The book begins by describing Bayard Sartoris and his slave friend Ringo playing in the dirt on the Sartoris plantation. A slave named Loosh smugly interrupts their game, hinting that Union armies have entered northeastern Mississippi, near their town of Jefferson. The boys do not fully understand, but when Bayard's father, Colonel John Sartoris, returns home from the front that day, they overhear him telling Granny Millard that Vicksburg has fallen. Loosh obviously knows about the defeat, and Bayard decides that he and Ringo will keep watch over Loosh. But several days into the watch, the boys spot a Yankee soldier on horseback riding up the road. The boys grab a musket off the wall and shoot at the soldier, then run into the house as a fist pounds on the front door. Granny hides them under her billowing skirts and insists to the angry Union sergeant that there are no children present. Colonel Dick, a Yankee officer, calls off the search but makes it clear that he is doing so out of pity, not because he believes Granny. Fortunately, the boys learn they have only killed a horse."

The journey to Memphis carries them through Union-occupied areas. One afternoon, men with guns waylay the travelers, stealing their mules despite Granny's attempts to fend them off. Bayard and Ringo take a horse from a nearby barn and try to pursue the attackers, leaving Granny to fend for herself. They are discovered asleep the next day by Colonel Sartoris's troop. Furious and worried for Granny, the colonel takes them back to Jefferson personally; on the way, they accidentally overcome the thieves, a group of Northern soldiers, and capture their supplies, though the colonel allows the men to escape.

One night Ringo rides to the university to tell him Colonel Sartoris has been killed by an ex-business partner and rival, Ben Redmond. Bayard will be expected to avenge his father and shoot Redmond. He rushes back to Jefferson, where Drusilla, in her yellow ball gown with a sprig of verbena in her hair, seems almost a priestess of revenge. She hands him a pair of dueling pistols, then breaks down in a hysterical fit of laughter. After Louvinia has led Drusilla to bed, Bayard's Aunt Jenny warns Bayard not to indulge in violence for its own sake. The next morning, Bayard rides into town with Ringo. A crowd gathers as he prepares to enter Redmond's office, but Bayard refuses offers of assistance from Ringo and of a pistol from a friend of his father's, George Wyatt. He enters Redmond's office; Redmond fires two shots at him, then takes his hat, walks across the square and boards a train out of Jefferson forever. The townspeople think Bayard has been killed; in fact, he has chosen to confront Redmond unarmed, breaking the cycle of violence without sacrificing his honor.

The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"The Waves is a portrait of the intertwined lives of six friends:
Bernard, Neville, Louis, Jinny, Susan, and Rhoda. The novel is divided into nine
sections, each of which corresponds to a time of day, and, symbolically, to a period
in the lives of the characters. Each section begins with a detailed description of
the course of this symbolic day."
The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"The second section deals with adolescence, after the boys and girls have been
sent off to their separate boarding schools. Bernard, Louis, and Neville differ in
their reactions to the school’s authority and traditions, and they all form
friendships with Percival, a popular, handsome boy who is to become a central figure
in the lives of the six main characters. All three boys develop literary ambitions
of some sort, though they differ markedly in their goals and expressions. The girls
mostly want school to be over and done with: Jinny desires to begin her real life in
society, Susan longs to return home to her father and her farm, and Rhoda wants an
escape from the disruptions to her mental solitude caused by school. At the
close of the section, each character sets out, whether for college,
work, or otherwise, on a more solitary track."
The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"The ninth and final section is told entirely from Bernard’s point of view.
Bernard speaks to a casual acquaintance over dinner, and tries to give a “summing
up” of his life. Bernard is still doubtful about the accuracy of any representation
of reality through language. He tries to give a sense of the texture of his life,
rather than making sweeping statements about it. Bernard discusses the others and
how things have turned out for them, including the fact that Rhoda has killed
herself. The most profound moment Bernard describes is one in which he himself seems
to move beyond language into a direct perception of reality. In the end, however,
Bernard sees his life as an attempt to use language to fight against death, and he
sees how the others have, in their individual ways, been part of the same struggle.
Bernard vows to keep fighting until the end."
The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"The third section traces the characters through young adulthood. Bernard and
Neville are at college together and remain close friends. They both admire Percival,
but Neville has fallen in love with him. Percival has become the focus of Neville’s
desire for beauty and perfection. Bernard is concerned with his own gregarious
nature and thinks deeply about the way his personality is constructed out of his
relationships with others. Neville shares one of his poems with Bernard, and the
moment is important for both of them. Louis is working as a mid-level clerk at a
shipping firm in London. He spends his lunch hour reading at a diner and
people-watching, hoping to make poetry out of his observations of everyday life.
Susan is at home on her farm and communes with the rhythm of natural life. She walks
across the fields before dawn and senses growth all around her, though she begins to
submerge her own active will. Back in London, Jinny and Rhoda attend the same party,
though their experiences are very different. Jinny comes fully alive in the social
setting, and she takes a great, sensual pleasure in the beauty of her surroundings
and in her own personal attractiveness. Rhoda, on the other hand, feels negated by
the others around her and longs to disappear."
The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"The fourth section is set later in adulthood and centers on a dinner party,
meant to honor Percival, who is leaving for a position in the colonial government in
India. At the party, the six characters are united again. At first, the group is
tense and uneasy in one another’s company, and they primarily notice their
differences. When Percival arrives, however, these tensions are relaxed and the
group comes together. Briefly, the friends are united in a moment of true communion,
and their individual voices seem to blend. All too soon, however, the
moment ends and the group dissolves back into its singular parts."
The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"In the sixth section, the characters have entered full maturity. Louis is
rising in his firm and leads a sort of double life. Although he is a respectable
businessman, he is drawn to the seamier side of life and spends his time roaming
around poorer neighborhoods. Louis and Rhoda have become lovers. Susan is a mother
now, both deeply gratified and stifled by her chosen life. On one hand, she is fully
a part of the cycle of natural life; on the other, her own life has become
subordinate to the lives of her children and the ongoing life of the farm. Jinny
continues her purely physical existence, taking lovers but never settling down,
content to revel in her own being. Neville also moves from lover to lover, but in
his case, he is trying to keep the intensity of first desire alive—it is the source
of his creativity."
The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"In the eighth section, the friends once again gather for a dinner, though this
time the meeting is shadowed by death, thanks both to their increasing age and to
the absence of Percival. Although there is tension among the friends, as at the
earlier meeting, this tension is resolved as they begin to share their common
experiences. The characters have lived long enough to know that this meeting is one
such common experience, and they have another moment of silent communion, though the
moment is elegiac rather than triumphant. Rhoda and Louis have a quiet moment
together as the others walk into the park, but it inevitably comes to an end."
The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"The seventh section deals with midlife, as the characters begin to age.
Bernard has traveled to Rome, where he observes the ruins and tries to come to terms
with his own sense of failure, as he has begun to doubt both his own abilities and
the ability of stories to capture reality. As Susan sinks deeper into her rural and
domestic life, she regrets what she has lost even as she finds a measure of
contentment in what she has gained. Jinny has a moment of dread in which she sees
that she is aging and her beauty is fading. She reconciles herself to the inevitable
passage of time, however, and resolves to make the most of her remaining years.
Neville is becoming a successful writer. He is mellowing a bit, but he continues to
shift the focus of his desire from lover to lover. Louis rises ever higher in his
firm but still returns to his attic room to write. Literature seems to him an
idealized realm even as his eye is continually drawn to the street. Rhoda has left
Louis and travels to Spain, where she too has a moment in which she comes face to
face with death—here in the form of the vast sea seen from the cliffs."
The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"The fifth section takes place not long after the dinner party, when the
friends have learned that Percival has been killed in India. Neville is devastated
by the news, overwhelmed by a sense of death and the fragility of life. Bernard is
torn between joy and sorrow: his child has just been born and his friend has just
died. Bernard goes to a museum to look at paintings and finds a kind of solace, even
as he is aware that his memories of Percival must inevitably fade. Rhoda finds a

The Waves,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/waves/summary.html,"The first section deals with early morning, or childhood, when the six main
characters are attending a day-school together. As each of the children awakens, he
or she begins an internal monologue composed of thoughts, feelings, and impressions.
The children interact in various ways throughout the day, and each begins to take
shape as an individual in response to the stimulus provided by the world and by the
presence of one another. Although their thoughts are somewhat incoherent and mostly
fixated on immediate experience, their distinct personalities begin to emerge:
Bernard’s loquacity and obsession with language; Neville’s desire for order and
beauty; Louis’s insecurity and ambition; Jinny’s physicality; Susan’s intensity and
attachment to nature; and Rhoda’s dreamlike abstraction from ordinary life."
The Winter's TaleWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/winterstale/summary.html,"Antigonus, meanwhile abandons the baby on the Bohemian coast, reporting that Hermione appeared to him in a dream and bade him name the girl Perdita and leave gold and other tokens on her person. Shortly thereafter, Antigonus is killed by a bear, and Perdita is raised by a kindly Shepherd. Sixteen years pass, and the son of Polixenes, Prince Florizel, falls in love with Perdita. His father and Camillo attend a sheepshearing in disguise and watch as Florizel and Perdita are betrothed—then, tearing off the disguise, Polixenes intervenes and orders his son never to see the Shepherd's daughter again. With the aid of Camillo, however, who longs to see his native land again, Florizel and Perdita take ship for Sicilia, after using the clothes of a local rogue, Autolycus, as a disguise. They are joined in their voyage by the Shepherd and his son, a Clown, who are directed there by Autolycus."
The Winter's TaleWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/winterstale/summary.html,"In Sicilia, Leontes—still in mourning after all this time—greets the son of his old friend effusively. Florizel pretends to be on a diplomatic mission from his father, but his cover is blown when Polixenes and Camillo, too, arrive in Sicilia. What happens next is told to us by gentlemen of the Sicilian court: the Shepherd tells everyone his story of how Perdita was found, and Leontes realizes that she is his daughter, leading to general rejoicing. The entire company then goes to Paulina's house in the country, where a statue of Hermione has been recently finished. The sight of his wife's form makes Leontes distraught, but then, to everyone's amazement, the statue comes to life—it is Hermione, restored to life. As the play ends, Paulina and Camillo are engaged, and the whole company celebrates the miracle."
The Winter's TaleWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/winterstale/summary.html,"King Leontes of Sicilia begs his childhood friend, King Polixenes of Bohemia, to extend his visit to Sicilia. Polixenes protests that he has been away from his kingdom for nine months, but after Leontes's pregnant wife, Hermione, pleads with him he relents and agrees to stay a little longer. Leontes, meanwhile, has become possessed with jealousy—convinced that Polixenes and Hermione are lovers, he orders his loyal retainer, Camillo, to poison the Bohemian king. Instead, Camillo warns Polixenes of what is afoot, and the two men flee Sicilia immediately."
The Winter's TaleWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/winterstale/summary.html,"Furious at their escape, Leontes now publicly accuses his wife of infidelity, and declares that the child she is bearing must be illegitimate. He throws her in prison, over the protests of his nobles, and sends to the Oracle of Delphi for what he is sure will be confirmation of his suspicions. Meanwhile, the queen gives birth to a girl, and her loyal friend Paulina brings the baby to the king, in the hopes that the sight of the child will soften his heart. He only grows angrier, however, and orders Paulina's husband, Lord Antigonus, to take the child and abandon it in some desolate place. While Antigonus is gone, the answer comes from Delphi—Hermione and Polixenes are innocent, and Leontes will have no heir until his lost daughter is found. As this news is revealed, word comes that Leontes's son, Mamillius, has died of a wasting sickness brought on by the accusations against his mother. Hermione, meanwhile, falls in a swoon, and is carried away by Paulina, who subsequently reports the queen's death to her heartbroken and repentant husband."
The Woman WarriorMaxine Hong Kingston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/womanwarrior/summary.html,"The Woman Warrior focuses on the stories of five women—Kingston's long-dead aunt, ""No-Name Woman""; a mythical female warrior, Fa Mu Lan; Kingston's mother, Brave Orchid; Kingston's aunt, Moon Orchid; and finally Kingston herself—told in five chapters. The chapters integrate Kingston's lived experience with a series of talk-stories—spoken stories that combine Chinese history, myths, and beliefs—her mother tells her."
The Woman WarriorMaxine Hong Kingston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/womanwarrior/summary.html,"""White Tigers"" is based on another talk-story, one about the mythical female warrior Fa Mu Lan. Fa Mu Lan, whose story is told through Kingston's first-person narrative, trains to become a warrior from the time she is seven years old, then leads an army of men—even pretending to be a man herself—against the forces of a corrupt baron and emperor. After her battles are over, she returns to be a wife and mother. The story of Fa Mu Lan is contrasted sharply with Kingston's own life in America, in which she can barely stand up to her racist bosses. Kingston realizes, however, that her weapons are her words."
The Woman WarriorMaxine Hong Kingston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/womanwarrior/summary.html,"The title of ""At the Western Palace"" refers to another of Brave Orchid's talk-stories, about an emperor who had four wives. It is an analogy for her sister Moon Orchid's situation: Moon Orchid's husband, now a successful Los Angeles doctor, had left her behind in China and remarried in America. Brave Orchid urges her sister into a disastrous confrontation with the man to demand her due as his wife. As a result, Moon Orchid, who does not speak a word of English, is left to fend for herself in America. She eventually goes crazy and dies in a California state mental asylum."
The Woman WarriorMaxine Hong Kingston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/womanwarrior/summary.html,"""Shaman"" focuses on Kingston's mother, Brave Orchid, and her old life back in China. Brave Orchid was a powerful doctor, midwife, and, according to the talk-story, destroyer of ghosts back in her village. To a young Kingston, Brave Orchid's past is as astounding as it is terrifying, and many of the images from her mother's talk-story—Chinese babies left to die, slave girls being bought and sold, a woman stoned to death by her villagers—haunt Kingston's dreams for years to come. At the end of the chapter, Maxine visits her mother after being away for many years. The two arrive at some kind of understanding after many years of disagreement and conflict, and Brave Orchid is warm and affectionate towards her daughter for the first time in the memoir."
The Woman WarriorMaxine Hong Kingston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/womanwarrior/summary.html,"The final chapter of the memoir, ""A Song for a Barbarian Reed Pipe,"" is about Kingston herself. This section focuses mainly on her childhood and teenage years, depicting her anger and frustration in trying to express herself and attempting to please an unappreciative mother. There are a number of characters whose personalities highlight many of her Kingston's own characteristics, including a silent Chinese girl whom Kingston torments as a little girl. In a pivotal moment in the chapter, Kingston, after unsuccessfully trying to express her feelings one at a time, erupts at her mother with a torrent of complaints and criticisms. Later in her life, however, Kingston comes to appreciate her mother's talk-stories. At the end of the chapter she even tells one herself: the story of Ts'ai Yen, a warrior poetess captured by barbarians who returns to the Chinese with songs from another land. It is a fitting conclusion to a text in which Kingston combines very different worlds and cultures and create a harmony of her own."
The Woman WarriorMaxine Hong Kingston,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/womanwarrior/summary.html,"The first chapter, ""No-Name Woman,"" begins with one such talk-story, about an aunt Kingston never knew she had. Because this aunt had brought disgrace upon her family by having an illegitimate child, she killed herself and her baby by jumping into the family well in China. After hearing the story, which is told to her as a warning, Kingston is never allowed to mention her aunt aloud again, so she decides to create a history of her aunt in her memoir. She imagines the ways that her aunt attracted a suitor, comparing her aunt's actions of quiet rebellion against the community to her own rebellion. Kingston also recreates her aunt's horrible experience of giving birth in a pigsty and imagines her aunt's ghost walking around with no one to give it gifts, as was Chinese custom. In the end, Kingston is unsure whether she is doing justice to her aunt's memory or just serving her own needs."

The Year of Magical ThinkingJoan Didion,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yearmagical/summary.html,"As she tries to make sense of John’s death and her own
changed identity, Didion discovers that grief is not what she expected
it to be. Consumed by memories of the years they lived in Los Angeles, shortly
after they married and adopted Quintana, Didion feels that she has
entered a state of temporary insanity. Though cool and collected
on the surface, she begins to believe that her wishes might have
the power to bring John back. To this end, she refuses to give away
his clothes and shoes, believing that her husband will need them
when he returns to her. She calls this childlike belief that her thoughts
and wishes can alter reality “magical thinking.” She finds numerous
examples of this behavior in the literature she studies on grief
and mourning, which ranges from poems, novels, psychological texts,
and even etiquette books."
The Year of Magical ThinkingJoan Didion,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yearmagical/summary.html,"Didion begins to examine her memories for omens and symbols that
might have warned her of John’s impending death. She looks to literature,
to events from their shared life , and to clues that John seemed
to leave in his own novels. She becomes consumed with the idea of
self-pity, its relationship to grief and mourning, and how these
feelings are perceived by society. Realizing that she had almost never
been separated from her husband during their forty years of marriage,
she finds herself turning inward in her solitude, consumed by her
own thoughts. In an effort to get back to her normal life, she makes
plans to cover the Democratic and Republican conventions for the New
York Review of Books. Though the conventions seem to pose
little risk of setting off the vortex effect, she finds herself
paralyzed by memories no matter where she goes or what she does."

she does, that she may have suffered brain damage. Didion immediately
flies to Los Angeles to be with Quintana, reassuring her that she
will get better even though she knows that she is powerless to protect
her daughter. Didion spends every day at the hospital and begins
to experience what she calls “the vortex effect,” a reaction in which
environmental triggers unexpectedly set off emotionally crippling
flashbacks of her life with John and Quintana. Though she tries
to avoid landmarks that remind her of in the happy years the family
spent in Los Angeles in the 1970s, the vortex
effect occurs at the most unexpected times. After several months,
Quintana moves to a stepdown observational unit, with plans made

Quintana."
The Year of Magical ThinkingJoan Didion,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yearmagical/summary.html,"As Didion tries to figure out a way to fix the situation
and bring John back, she becomes fixated on her memories of the
months leading up to his death. Also in December of that year, Quintana
had developed a severe case of flu that worsened in the days leading
up to Christmas, though doctors reassured her that she was on the
road to recovery. On Christmas morning, Quintana checked into the
hospital, where she went into septic shock as a result of the pneumonia that
had overtaken her lungs. Though John’s spirits had been buoyed by
both a new pacemaker as well as Quintana’s wedding earlier that
year, the news of his daughter’s condition devastated him, prompting
him to begin assessing his own life. Several days before his death,
John had told his wife that he felt he was a failure. Quintana doesn’t
wake from her coma until January 2004, though soon
after being discharged she must return briefly, because of blood
clotting in her legs. After her second release, the family decides
to hold the funeral for John, after which Quintana will travel to

The Year of Magical ThinkingJoan Didion,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yearmagical/summary.html,"Didion begins to feel that she has gone insane as she
experiences both magical thinking and the vortex effect. To regain
her grip on reality, Didion looks back to her past and tries to
remember what the world used to mean to her. As a child, she remembers,
she fixated on meaninglessness, believing that the massive geological
changes that occur slowly over time indicated the smallness and
brevity of human experience. As an adult, she had once found meaning
in the routines of her life and in her role as a wife and mother,
but she now realizes that, following John’s death, she has lost
the sense of self those roles once afforded her. Though she understands
that John is dead, Didion cannot understand how or why. Her thinking
only begins to clarify once she receives the emergency room and
autopsy reports, nearly a year after John’s death. The reports confirm
that John was dead from the moment he sat down to dinner. Didion could
have tried to fix the situation, but it would have been futile; there
was nothing she could have done about it then, and nothing she can
do about it now. Didion’s vivid memories of the months before John’s
death begin to fade, but though her heated mental state subsides,
no clarity or sense of purpose replaces it. Didion begins to focus
again on the routines of daily life, accepting the inevitability
of change, which forces us to adapt and, eventually, to move on."
The Yellow WallpaperCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/summary.html,"As the Fourth of July passes, the narrator reports that her family has just
visited, leaving her more tired than ever. John threatens to send her to Weir
Mitchell, the real-life physician under whose care Gilman had a nervous breakdown.
The narrator is alone most of the time and says that she has become almost fond of
the wallpaper and that attempting to figure out its pattern has become her primary
entertainment. As her obsession grows, the sub-pattern of the wallpaper becomes
clearer. It begins to resemble a woman “stooping down and creeping” behind the main
pattern, which looks like the bars of a cage. Whenever the narrator tries to discuss
leaving the house, John makes light of her concerns, effectively silencing her. Each
time he does so, her disgusted fascination with the paper grows."
The Yellow WallpaperCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/summary.html,"By the end, the narrator is hopelessly insane, convinced that there are many
creeping women around and that she herself has come out of the wallpaper—that she
herself is the trapped woman. She creeps endlessly around the room, smudging the
wallpaper as she goes. When John breaks into the locked room and sees the full
horror of the situation, he faints in the doorway, so that the narrator has “to
creep over him every time!”"
The Yellow WallpaperCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/summary.html,"The sub-pattern now clearly resembles a woman who is trying to get out from
behind the main pattern. The narrator sees her shaking the bars at night and
creeping around during the day, when the woman is able to escape briefly. The
narrator mentions that she, too, creeps around at times. She suspects that John and
Jennie are aware of her obsession, and she resolves to destroy the paper once and
for all, peeling much of it off during the night. The next day she manages to be
alone and goes into something of a frenzy, biting and tearing at the paper in order
to free the trapped woman, whom she sees struggling from inside the pattern."
The Yellow WallpaperCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/summary.html,"As the first few weeks of the summer pass, the narrator becomes good at hiding
her journal, and thus hiding her true thoughts from John. She continues to long for
more stimulating company and activity, and she complains again about John’s
patronizing, controlling ways—although she immediately returns to the wallpaper,
which begins to seem not only ugly, but oddly menacing. She mentions that John is
worried about her becoming fixated on it, and that he has even refused to repaper
the room so as not to give in to her neurotic worries. The narrator’s imagination,
however, has been aroused. She mentions that she enjoys picturing people on the
walkways around the house and that John always discourages such fantasies. She also
thinks back to her childhood, when she was able to work herself into a terror by
imagining things in the dark. As she describes the bedroom, which she says must have
been a nursery for young children, she points out that the paper is torn off the
wall in spots, there are scratches and gouges in the floor, and the furniture is
heavy and fixed in place. Just as she begins to see a strange sub-pattern behind the
main design of the wallpaper, her writing is interrupted again, this time by John’s
sister, Jennie, who is acting as housekeeper and nurse for the narrator."
The Yellow WallpaperCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/summary.html,"The narrator begins her journal by marveling at the grandeur of the house and
grounds her husband has taken for their summer vacation. She describes it in
romantic terms as an aristocratic estate or even a haunted house and wonders how
they were able to afford it, and why the house had been empty for so long. Her
feeling that there is “something queer” about the situation leads her into a
discussion of her illness—she is suffering from “nervous depression”—and of her
marriage. She complains that her husband John, who is also her doctor, belittles
both her illness and her thoughts and concerns in general. She contrasts his
practical, rationalistic manner with her own imaginative, sensitive ways. Her
treatment requires that she do almost nothing active, and she is especially
forbidden from working and writing. She feels that activity, freedom, and
interesting work would help her condition and reveals that she has begun her secret
journal in order to “relieve her mind.” In an attempt to do so, the narrator begins
describing the house. Her description is mostly positive, but disturbing elements
such as the “rings and things” in the bedroom walls, and the bars on the windows,
keep showing up. She is particularly disturbed by the yellow wallpaper in the
bedroom, with its strange, formless pattern, and describes it as “revolting.” Soon,
however, her thoughts are interrupted by John’s approach, and she is forced to stop
writing."
The Yellow WallpaperCharlotte Perkins Gilman,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/yellowwallpaper/summary.html,"Soon the wallpaper dominates the narrator’s imagination. She becomes
possessive and secretive, hiding her interest in the paper and making sure no one
else examines it so that she can “find it out” on her own. At one point, she
startles Jennie, who had been touching the wallpaper and who mentions that she had
found yellow stains on their clothes. Mistaking the narrator’s fixation for
tranquility, John thinks she is improving. But she sleeps less and less and is
convinced that she can smell the paper all over the house, even outside. She
discovers a strange smudge mark on the paper, running all around the room, as if it
had been rubbed by someone crawling against the wall."

We're talking fourteen dead bodies, kung-fu, sword-fu, spear-fu, dagger-fu, arrow-fu, pie-fu, animal screams on the soundtrack, heads roll, hands roll, tongues roll, nine and a half quarts of blood, and a record-breaking 94 on the vomit meter.""

each promised only a thousand pounds. Tom experiences great emotion at 
Allworthy's illness and barely leaves his bedside. A lawyer named Dowling 
arrives and announces the sudden and unexpected death of Bridget Allworthy. 
When the doctor announces that Allworthy will not die, Tom rejoices and gets 
drunk on both joy and alcohol. Blifil calls Tom a ""bastard"" and Tom retaliates 
by hitting him. Tom, after swearing eternal constancy to Sophia, encounters 
Molly by chance and makes love to her."
Tom JonesHenry Fielding,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomjones/summary.html,"Tom spends much time with Squire Western—Allworthy's 
neighbor—since the Squire is impressed by Tom's sportsmanship. Sophia 
Western, Squire Western's daughter, falls deeply in love with Tom. Tom has 
already bestowed his affection on Molly Seagrim, the poor but feisty 
daughter of Black George. When Molly becomes pregnant, Tom prevents Allworthy 
from sending Molly to prison by admitting that he has fathered her child. Tom, 
at first oblivious to Sophia's charms and beauty, falls deeply in love with her, 
and begins to resent his ties to Molly. Yet he remains with Molly out of honor. 
Tom's commitment to Molly ends when he discovers that she has been having 
affairs, which means Tom is not the father of her child and frees him to confess 
his feelings to Sophia."
Tom JonesHenry Fielding,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tomjones/summary.html,"Mrs. Waters also reveals that Tom's mother was Bridget Allworthy. Square sends 
Allworthy a letter explaining that Tom's conduct during Allworthy's illness was 
honorable and compassionate. Tom is released from jail and he and Allworthy are 
reunited as nephew and uncle. Mrs. Miller explains to Sophia the reasons for 
Tom's marriage proposal to Lady Bellaston, and Sophia is satisfied. Now that Tom 
is Allworthy's heir, Squire Western eagerly encourages the marriage between Tom 
and Sophia. Sophia chastises Tom for his lack of chastity, but agrees to marry 
him. They live happily on Western's estate with two children, and shower 
everyone around them with kindness and generosity."

London to discover a baby boy in is bed. Allworthy undertakes to uncover the 
mother and father of this foundling, and finds local woman Jenny Jones and 
her tutor, Mr. Partridge, guilty. Allworthy sends Jenny away from the 
county, and the poverty-stricken Partridge leaves of his own accord. In spite of 
the criticism of the parish, Allworthy decides to bring up the boy. Soon after, 
Bridget marries Captain Blifil, a visitor at Allworthy's estate, and gives 
birth to a son of her own, named Blifil. Captain Blifil regards Tom Jones

Tom is his wife's lover and begins a duel with Tom. In defending himself, Tom 
stabs Fitzpatrick with the sword and is thrown into jail. Partridge visits Tom 
in jail with the ghastly news that Mrs. Waters is Jenny Jones, Tom's mother. 
Mrs. Waters meets with Allworthy and explains that Fitzpatrick is still alive, 
and has admitted to initiating the duel. She also tells Allworthy that a lawyer 
acting on behalf of an unnamed gentleman tried to persuade her to conspire 
against Tom. Allworthy realizes that Blifil is this very gentleman, and he 
decides never to speak to him again. Tom, however, takes pity on Blifil and

stay at her brother's house. She and the Squire fight constantly, but they unite 
over Mrs. Western's plan to marry Sophia to Blifil. Mrs. Western promises not to 
reveal Sophia's love for Tom as long as Sophia submits to receiving Blifil as a 
suitor. Blifil thus begins his courtship of Sophia, and brags so much about his 
progress that Allworthy believes that Sophia must love Blifil. Sophia, however, 
strongly opposes the proposal, and Squire Western grows violent with her. Blifil 
tells Allworthy that Tom is a rascal who cavorted drunkenly about the house, and 
Allworthy banishes Tom from the county. Tom does not want to leave Sophia, but

brought up together, but receive vastly different treatment from the other 
members of the household. Allworthy is the only person who shows consistent 
affection for Tom. The philosopher Square and the reverend Thwackum, the 
boys' tutors, despise Tom and adore Blifil, since Tom is wild and Blifil is 
pious. Tom frequently steals apples and ducks to support the family of Black 
George, one of Allworthy's servants. Tom tells all of his secrets to Blifil, 
who then relates these to Thwackum or Allworthy, thereby getting Tom into

Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"As the months pass, many more stories accumulate around the group. On St. Andrew's Eve Pilon and Big Joe think they have found treasure but it turns out to be a signpost for a geological survey. There are affairs with women, but the companionship within the group is much stronger than the affections any of them have for women. In the end, the romantic paisano returns to the group having relearned this lesson. In many cases, the paisanos provide a service to a needy party. One time, they house and feed a distraught caporal from the Mexican Army with his baby when the two have nowhere else to go. Another time, they save the large family of Senora Teresina Cortez from starvation when the local bean crop fails."
Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"Danny's funeral is a public debacle of fine clothes, stolen flowers, and military splendor. The paisanos cannot attend, however, for if they enter the proceedings in their poor clothes it would be a disgrace to Danny's memory. Instead, they watch from afar until they cannot stand the sorrow any longer and burst into tears. That night, they drink more wine and talk fondly of Danny's memory. They sing songs that he liked and smoke cigars provided by Tito Ralph. As Pilon attempts to relight one of the cigars, the match flutters out of his hand and ignites a newspaper in the corner. At first, they all get up to stamp the fire out, but they change their minds. The house dies, as Danny did, in one last blaze of glory. When there is nothing but ashes left, the friends depart, each going his separate way."
Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"Sometimes there is wine, and sometimes there is food, but there is always the pleasure that each of them receives from the company of the others. Eventually the Pirate reaches his goal of one thousand quarters and buys a golden candlestick for Saint Francisco. The friends have a small party for this occasion with hamburger meat and wine bought from the plunder of a downed coast guard ship. When there is nothing going on, they rather spend their days in philosophical discussion of town gossip, enjoying the sun on their front porch. Often the stories are scandalous, but there is always a lesson to be learned from them."
Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"It is said that Danny drank three gallons of wine by himself that night, and no woman in town would admit that he passed her up in his marathon of affairs. The party became legendary for its greatness. Everyone in the whole town was there and they danced so hard that the floor of the house caved in at points. More than thirty gallons of wine and a keg of potato whiskey were consumed. Unfortunately, the night ended in tragedy. After the good-natured fights that ritually accompanied a night of drinking, Danny was not finished. He picked up a table leg and challenged the entire world to a fight. When no one took the challenge, he charged outside, screaming that if no one would fight him then he would pit himself against an enemy worthy of his efforts. Danny plummeted to fatal wounds in the forty-foot drop to the bottom of the gulch behind his house. No one was sure what really happened, but everyone was sure that they had heard Danny fighting with some supernatural enemy before he let out his last scream of defiance."
Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"Most of the group's quests revolve around the acquisition of money, but in one case, they find a new friend instead. There was a paisano in town named the Pirate who was somewhat slow witted. He could be seen walking the streets and perusing the restaurants for scraps with his five dogs (his best friends and protectors). He chopped wood every day and sold it for a quarter in town. Pilon noticed that the Pirate never spent any money, and deduced that he must be hiding it somewhere. Pilon follows the bum all over trying to locate the stash, going so far as to invite him to stay in Danny's house so that they can keep a better watch over him. In living with the pirate, the friends grow compassionate for him, however, and one day the Pirate simply turns over the money to the friends so that it will be safe. The large bag of coins becomes the symbolic center of the friendship."
Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"The monotony of the paisano way of life and the weight of property ownership begins to wear on Danny, however. For a month, he sits on the porch with his friends brooding over memories of nights sleeping in the forest and the infinitely better taste of stolen food. In the end, the weight is too much and Danny gives into to his desires to reexperience his youth. He disappears into the woods and goes on a month long crime spree. He steals from everyone, including the members of his own household. Husbands all over town call for vengeance for what he has done to their wives, and the police swear that he will be arrested on sight for his vandalism and fighting. Mr. Torrelli, the wine merchant, even produces a note that Danny has signed authorizing the sale of the house for $25 dollars. Luckily, the merchant did not think to make a backup copy and the paisanos quickly dispose of the original. When Danny finally returns, he is tired and pleased with the fun he has had, but the growing sense of age is still with him."
Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"In the town of Tortilla Flat above beautiful Monterey lived a group of men called the paisanos. They were drunkards, thieves, ruffians, and vagabonds, but they were also surprisingly good at heart; requiring little more from life than friendship and a little wine. Among these paisanos were Danny, Pilon, Pablo, Jesus Maria, and Big Joe Portagee. When the First World War broke out, these paisanos decided to enlist in a fir of drunken patriotism. None of them actually made it anywhere near combat, and soon returned to Monterey to find it more or less as they had left it. One thing was different however, Danny's grandfather had died and left Danny two houses."
Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"Pilon is the first to find Danny after the war, and Danny allows his friend to rent the other house from him. Gradually, the rest of the group turns up, and Pilon convinces them to rent rooms in the second house. One night, after a good amount of wine, the house burns down, and though Danny is angry at first, he allows the friends to move in with him. At Danny's house, they form a group, which Steinbeck often compares to the Knights of the Round Table. Indeed, they engage in many quests, some noble, and some downright sinful, enjoying companionship and the comfort of a roof to the fullest."
Tortilla Flat,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tortillaflat/summary.html,"Seeing their friend and their host in such a state, the friends of the house decide to cure him with a party. For the first time in their lives, the five, along with Tito Ralph, the jailer, and Johnny Pom-Pom go to work in the squid yards. Word of this earth-shattering event quickly spreads through Tortilla Flat and soon it is leaked that they are trying to make money to have a party. The whole town gets behind their effort, preparing food, digging up long saved booze, and buying wine and decorations. At four-thirty, Danny gets up and goes for a walk in the direction of Monterey and while he is gone, neighbors swarm on the house, decorating it. At five-thirty, the seven friends walk home with fourteen gallons of wine bought with their day's wages. They set out to find Danny and get the party started. Pilon and Pablo find him gloomily standing on a dark pier in Monterey. Pablo later swears that he saw an unearthly black bird hanging over Danny's head. When they give Danny word of the party, he is invigorated and the three race back up the hill to get things started."

Tristram ShandyLaurence Sterne,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tristram/summary.html,"The second major plot consists of the fortunes of Tristram's Uncle Toby. Most of the details of this story are concentrated in the final third of the novel, although they are alluded to and developed in piecemeal fashion from the very beginning. Toby receives a wound to the groin while in the army, and it takes him four years to recover. When he is able to move around again, he retires to the country with the idea of constructing a scaled replica of the scene of the battle in which he was injured. He becomes obsessed with re-enacting those battles, as well as with the whole history and theory of fortification and defense. The Peace of Utrecht slows him down in these ""hobby-horsical"" activities, however, and it is during this lull that he falls under the spell of Widow Wadman. The novel ends with the long-promised account of their unfortunate affair."
Tristram ShandyLaurence Sterne,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tristram/summary.html,"The action covered in Tristram Shandy spans the years 1680-1766. Sterne obscures the story's underlying chronology, however, by rearranging the order of the various pieces of his tale. He also subordinates the basic plot framework by weaving together a number of different stories, as well as such disparate materials as essays, sermons, and legal documents. There are, nevertheless, two clearly discernible narrative lines in the book."
Tristram ShandyLaurence Sterne,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/tristram/summary.html,"The first is the plot sequence that includes Tristram's conception, birth, christening, and accidental circumcision. (This sequence extends somewhat further in Tristram's treatment of his ""breeching,"" the problem of his education, and his first and second tours of France, but these events are handled less extensively and are not as central to the text.) It takes six volumes to cover this chain of events, although comparatively few pages are spent in actually advancing such a simple plot. The story occurs as a series of accidents, all of which seem calculated to confound Walter Shandy's hopes and expectations for his son. The manner of his conception is the first disaster, followed by the flattening of his nose at birth, a misunderstanding in which he is given the wrong name, and an accidental run-in with a falling window-sash. The catastrophes that befall Tristram are actually relatively trivial; only in the context of Walter Shandy's eccentric, pseudo-scientific theories do they become calamities."
Troilus and CressidaWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/troilus/summary.html,"In the seventh year of the Trojan War, a Trojan prince named Troilus falls in love with Cressida, the daughter of a Trojan priest who has defected to the Greek side. Troilus is assisted in his pursuit of her by Pandarus, Cressida's uncle. Meanwhile, in the Greek camp, the Greek general, Agamemnon, wonders why his commanders seem so downcast and pessimistic. The wise and crafty Ulysses informs him that the army's troubles spring from a lack of respect for authority, brought about by the behavior of Achilles, the greatest Greek warrior, who refuses to fight and instead spends his time sitting in his tent with his comrade (and lover) Patroclus, mocking his superiors. Shortly thereafter, a challenge to single combat arrives from Prince Hector, the greatest Trojan warrior, and Ulysses decides to have Ajax, a headstrong fool, fight Hector instead of Achilles, in the hopes that this snub will wound Achilles's pride and bring him back into the war."
Troilus and CressidaWilliam Shakespeare,http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/troilus/summary.html,"That night, Pandarus brings Troilus and Cressida together, and after they pledge to be forever true to one another, he leads them to a bedchamber to consummate their love. Meanwhile, Cressida's father, the treacherous Trojan priest Calchas, asks the Greek commanders to exchange a Trojan prisoner for his daughter, so that he may be reunited with her. The commanders agree, and the next morning—to Troilus and Cressida's dismay—the trade is made, and a Greek lord named Diomedes leads Cressida away from Troy. That afternoon, Ajax and Hector fight to a draw, and after Hector and Achilles exchange insults, Hector and Troilus feast with the Greeks under a flag of truce. As the camp goes to bed, Ulysses leads Troilus to the tent of Calchas, where the Trojan prince watches from hiding as Cressida agrees to become Diomedes's lover."

Hector argues for peace, but he is won over by the impassioned Troilus, who wants to continue the struggle. In the Greek camp, Thersites, Ajax's foul-mouthed slave, abuses everyone who crosses his path. His master, meanwhile, has been honored by the commanders over the sulking Achilles, and is to fight Hector the next day."

The Trojans drive the Greeks back, but Patroclus is killed, which brings a vengeful Achilles back into the war, finally. Achilles is unable to defeat Hector in single combat, but he later catches him unarmed and, together with a gang of Greek warriors, slaughters him.

Soon before Morrie's death, when his condition has deteriorated so much that he can no longer breathe or move on his own, he confides that if he could have another son, he would choose Mitch."
Tuesdays with MorrieMitch Albom,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/morrie/summary.html,"In his lessons, Morrie advises Mitch to reject the popular culture in favor of creating his own. The individualistic culture Morrie encourages Mitch to create for himself is a culture founded on love, acceptance, and human goodness, a culture that upholds a set of ethical values unlike the mores that popular culture endorses. Popular culture, Morrie says, is founded on greed, selfishness, and superficiality, which he urges Mitch to overcome. Morrie also stresses that he and Mitch must accept death and aging, as both are inevitable."

Charlie marries Eva, a kind woman who gives Morrie and his brother the love and affection they need. Eva also instills in Morrie his love of books and his desire for education. However, Charlie insists that Morrie keep his mother's death a secret, as he wants Morrie's younger brother to believe that Eva is his biological mother. This demand to keep his mother's death a secret proves a terrible emotional burden for young Morrie; he keeps the telegram all of his life as proof that his mother had existed.

Tuesdays with MorrieMitch Albom,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/morrie/summary.html,"Following their first Tuesday together, Mitch returns regularly every Tuesday to listen to Morrie's lessons on ""The Meaning of Life."" Each week, Mitch brings Morrie food to eat, though as Morrie's condition worsens he is no longer able to enjoy solid food. In his first of three interviews with Koppel for ""Nightline,"" Morrie admits that the thing he dreads most about his worsening condition is that someday, he will not be able to wipe himself after using the bathroom. Eventually, this fear comes true."
Tuesdays with MorrieMitch Albom,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/morrie/summary.html,"Shortly after his reunion with Morrie, Mitch works himself nearly to death reporting on the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London. There, he spends much time thinking about Morrie and forfeits reading the tabloids, as he now seeks more meaning in his life and knows that he will not gain this meaning from reading about celebrities and gossip. He is knocked over by a swarm of reporters chasing celebrities Andre Agassi and Brooke Shields, and it is then that Mitch realizes he is chasing after the wrong thing. When he returns to his home in Detroit, Mitch learns that the article he has worked so hard to write will not even be published, as the union he belongs to is striking against the newspaper he works for. Once more, Mitch travels to Boston to visit Morrie."
Tuesdays with MorrieMitch Albom,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/morrie/summary.html,"On one Tuesday, Janine travels with Mitch to visit Morrie. Janine is a professional singer, and Morrie asks her to sing for him. Though she does not usually sing upon request, Janine concedes, and her voice moves Morrie to tears. Morrie cries freely and often, and continually encourages Mitch to do so also. As Morrie's condition deteriorates, so does that of the pink hibiscus plant that sits on the window ledge in his study. Mitch becomes increasingly aware of the evil in media, as it drenches the country with stories of murder and hatred. One such story is the murder trial of O.J. Simpson, the verdict of which causes major racial division between whites and blacks."
Tuesdays with MorrieMitch Albom,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/morrie/summary.html,"Meanwhile, at Morrie's insistence, Mitch attempts to restore his relationship with his brother Peter who lives in Spain. For many years, Peter has refused his family's help in battling pancreatic cancer and insists on seeking treatment alone. Mitch calls Peter and leaves numerous phone messages, though the only reply he receives from his brother is a curt message in which Peter insists he is fine, and reminds Mitch that he does not want to talk about his illness. Morrie prophetizes that Mitch will once more become close with his brother, a prophecy which, after Morrie's death, is realized. At Morrie's funeral, Mitch recalls his promise to continue his conversations with his professor and conducts a silent dialogue with Morrie in his head. Mitch had expected such a dialogue to feel awkward, however this communication feels far more natural than he had ever expected."

whip a fellow slave as ordered. Tom receives a severe beating, and Legree

Through their conversation, we learn that Yelena and the professor are departing that evening. Voynitsky and Astrov then enter, the latter asking Vanya to return a stolen bottle of morphine. Voynitsky declares that he is now nothing but a madman. For Astrov, Voynitsky is not mad but ""eccentric""—such is the ""normal condition"" of man. Dreading the empty years to come, Voynitsky begs Astrov to help him start a new life. Annoyed, Astrov tells him he can do nothing: the provinces have poisoned them both.

Some disconcerting comic relief ensues involving a tipsy Astrov and guitar-playing Telegin (an impoverished landowner dubbed ""Waffles"" for his pockmarked face). Once Voynitsky has exited, Sonya, who has entered the room in the meantime, converses with the brooding Astrov. The doctor moans that he cannot love but is ""fascinated"" by beauty (namely Yelena's).

The tragedy only makes the remaining Lisbon sisters more fascinating to the boys, who manage to obtain Cecilia's surprisingly mundane diary and read it aloud obsessively to each other, imagining themselves into the girls' lives. Yet they can neither find nor intuit a ready explanation for her death."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"The third act begins with a soliloquy from Mosca, indicating that he is growing increasingly conscious of his power and his independence from Volpone. Mosca then runs into Bonario, Corbaccio's son, and informs the young man of his father's plans to disinherit him. He has Bonario come back to Volpone's house with him, in order to watch Corbaccio sign the documents (hoping that Bonario might kill Corbaccio then and there out of rage, thus allowing Volpone to gain his inheritance early). Meanwhile Lady Politic again arrives at Volpone's residence, indicating that it is now mid-morning, approaching noon. This time, Volpone lets her in, but he soon regrets it, for he is exasperated by her talkativeness. Mosca rescues Volpone by telling the Lady that Sir Politic has been seen in a gondola with a courtesan (a high-class prostitute). Volpone then prepares for his seduction of Celia, while Mosca hides Bonario in a corner of the bedroom, in anticipation of Corbaccio's arrival. But Celia and Corvino arrive first—Celia complains bitterly about being forced to be unfaithful, while Corvino tells her to be quiet and do her job. When Celia and Volpone are alone together, Volpone greatly surprises Celia by leaping out of bed. Celia had expected and old, infirm man, but what she gets instead is a lothario who attempts to seduce her with a passionate speech. Always the good Christian, Celia refuses Volpone's advances, at which point Volpone says that he will rape her. But Bonario, who has been witnessing the scene from his hiding place the entire time, rescues Celia. Bonario wounds Mosca on his way out. Corbaccio finally arrives, too late, as does Voltore. Mosca plots, with Voltore's assistance, how to get Volpone out of this mess."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"In the first act, each legacy hunter arrives to present a gift to Volpone, except for Corbaccio, who offers only a worthless (and probably poisoned) vial of medicine. But Corbaccio agrees to return later in the day to make Volpone his heir, so that Volpone will return the favor. This act is a boon to Volpone, since Corbaccio, in all likelihood, will die long before Volpone does. After each hunter leaves, Volpone and Mosca laugh at each's gullibility. After Corvino's departure Lady Politic Would-be, the wife of an English knight living in Venice, arrives at the house but is told to come back three hours later. And Volpone decides that he will try to get a close look at Corvino's wife, Celia, who Mosca describes as one of the most beautiful women in all of Italy. She is kept under lock and key by her husband, who has ten guards on her at all times, but Volpone vows to use disguise to get around these barriers."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"The second act portrays a time just a short while later that day, and we meet Sir Politic Would-be, Lady Politic's husband, who is conversing with Peregrine, an young English traveler who has just landed in Venice. Sir Politic takes a liking to the young boy and vows to teach him a thing or two about Venice and Venetians; Peregrine, too, enjoys the company of Sir Politic, but only because he is hilariously gullible and vain. The two are walking in the public square in front of Corvino's house and are interrupted by the arrival of ""Scoto Mantua,"" actually Volpone in diguise as an Italian mountebank, or medicine-show man. Scoto engages in a long and colorful speech, hawking his new ""oil"", which is touted as a cure-all for disease and suffering. At the end of the speech, he asks the crows to toss him their handkerchiefs, and Celia complies. Corvino arrives, just as she does this, and flies into a jealous rage, scattering the crows in the square. Volpone goes home and complains to Mosca that he is sick with lust for Celia, and Mosca vows to deliver her to Volpone. Meanwhile, Corvino berates his wife for tossing her handkerchief, since he interprets it as a sign of her unfaithfulness, and he threatens to murder her and her family as a result. He decrees that, as punishment, she will now no longer be allowed to go to Church, she cannot stand near windows (as she did when watching Volpone), and, most bizarrely, she must do everything backwards from now on–she must even walk and speak backwards. Mosca then arrives, implying to Corvino that if he lets Celia sleep with Volpone (as a ""restorative"" for Volpone's failing health), then Volpone will choose him as his heir. Suddenly, Corvino's jealousy disappears, and he consents to the offer."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"A short while later, in the early afternoon, Peregrine and Sir Politic are still talking. Sir Politic gives the young traveler some advice on living in Venice and describes several schemes he has under consideration for making a great deal of money. They are soon interrupted by Lady Politic, who is convinced that Peregrine is the prostitute Mosca told her about—admittedly, in disguise. But Mosca arrives and tells Lady Politic that she is mistaken; the courtesan he referred to is now in front of the Senate (in other words, Celia). Lady Politic believes him and ends by giving Peregrine a seductive goodbye with a coy suggestion that they see each other again. Peregrine is incensed at her behavior and vows revenge on Sir Politic because of it. The scene switches to the Scrutineo, the Venetian Senate building, where Celia and Bonario have informed the judges of Venice about Volpone's deceit, Volpone's attempt to rape Celia, Corbaccio's disinheritance of his son, and Corvino's decision to prostitute his wife. But the defendants make a very good case for themselves, led by their lawyer, Voltore. Voltore portrays Bonario and Celia as lovers, Corvino as an innocent jilted husband, and Corbaccio as a wounded father nearly killed by his evil son. The judge are swayed when Lady Politic comes in and (set up perfectly by Mosca) identifies Celia as the seducer of her husband Sir Politic. Further, they are convinced when Volpone enters the courtroom, again acting ill. The judges order that Celia and Bonario be arrested and separated."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"Meanwhile, Peregrine is in disguise himself, playing his own prank on Sir Politic. Peregrine presents himself as a merchant to the knight and informs Politic that word has gotten out of his plan to sell Venice to the Turks. Politic, who once mentioned the idea in jest, is terrified. When three merchants who are in collusion with Peregrine knock on the door, Politic jumps into a tortoise-shell wine case to save himself. Peregrine informs the merchants when they enter that he is looking at a valuable tortoise. The merchants decide to jump on the tortoise and demand that it crawls along the floor. They remark loudly upon its leg-garters and fine hand-gloves, before turning it over to reveal Sir Politic. Peregrine and the merchants go off, laughing at their prank, and Sir Politic moans about how much he agrees with his wife's desire to leave Venice and go back to England."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"Volpone takes place in seventeenth-century Venice, over the course of one day. The play opens at the house of Volpone, a Venetian nobleman. He and his ""parasite"" Mosca—part slave, part servant, part lackey—enter the shrine where Volpone keeps his gold. Volpone has amassed his fortune, we learn, through dishonest means: he is a con artist. And we also learn that he likes to use his money extravagantly."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"Soon, we see Volpone's latest con in action. For the last three years, he has been attracting the interest of three legacy hunters: Voltore, a lawyer; Corbaccio, an old gentleman; and Corvino, a merchant—individuals interested in inheriting his estate after he dies. Volpone is known to be rich, and he is also known to be childless, have no natural heirs. Furthermore, he is believed to very ill, so each of the legacy hunters lavishes gifts on him, in the hope that Volpone, out of gratitude, will make him his heir. The legacy hunters do not know that Volpone is actually in excellent health and merely faking illness for the purpose of collecting all those impressive ""get-well"" gifts."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"Meanwhile, Volpone gloats in front of each legacy hunter, deriding them for having lost Volpone's inheritance to a parasite such as Mosca, and he successfully avoids recognition. But his plan backfires nonetheless. Voltore, driven to such a state of distraction by Volpone's teasing, decides to recant his testimony in front of the Senate, implicating both himself but more importantly Mosca as a criminal. Corvino accuses him of being a sore loser, upset that Mosca has inherited Volpone's estate upon his death, and the news of this death surprises the Senators greatly. Volpone nearly recovers from his blunder by telling Voltore, in the middle of the Senate proceeding, that ""Volpone"" is still alive. Mosca pretends to faint and claims to the Senate that he does not know where he is, how he got there, and that he must have been possessed by a demon during the last few minutes when he was speaking to them. He also informs the Senators that Volpone is not dead, contradicting Corvino. All seems good for Volpone until Mosca returns, and, instead of confirming Voltore's claim that Volpone is alive, Mosca denies it. Mosca, after all, has a will, written by Volpone and in his signaure, stating that he is Volpone's heir. now that Volpone is believed to be dead, Mosca legally owns Volpone's property, and Mosca tells Volpone that he is not going to give it back by telling the truth. Realizing that he has been betrayed, Volpone decides that rather than let Mosca inherit his wealth, he will turn them both in. Volpone takes off his disguise and finally reveals the truth about the events of the past day. Volpone ends up being sent to prison, while Mosca is consigned to a slave galley. Voltore is disbarred, Corbaccio is stripped of his property (which is given to his son Bonario), and Corvino is publicly humiliated, forced to wear donkey's ears while being rowed around the canals of Venice. At the end, there is a small note from the playwright to the audience, simply asking them to applaud if they enjoyed the play they just saw."
VolponeBen Jonson,http://www.sparknotes.com/drama/volpone/summary.html,"In the final act, Volpone returns home tired and worried that he is actually growing ill, for he is now feeling some of the symptoms he has been faking. To dispel his fears, he decides to engage in one final prank on the legacy hunters. He spreads a rumor that he has died and then tells Mosca to pretend that he has been made his master's heir. The plan goes off perfectly, and all three legacy hunters are fooled. Volpone then disguises himself as a Venetian guard, so that he can gloat in each legacy hunter's face over their humiliation, without being recognized. But Mosca lets the audience know that Volpone is dead in the eyes of the world and that Mosca will not let him ""return to the world of the living"" unless Volpone pays up, giving Mosca a share of his wealth."

Walden,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/summary.html,"Despite his isolation, Thoreau feels the presence of
society surrounding him. The Fitchburg Railroad rushes past Walden
Pond, interrupting his reveries and forcing him to contemplate the
power of technology. Thoreau also finds occasion to converse with
a wide range of other people, such as the occasional peasant farmer,
railroad worker, or the odd visitor to Walden. He describes in some detail
his association with a Canadian-born woodcutter, Alex Therien, who
is grand and sincere in his character, though modest in intellectual
attainments. Thoreau makes frequent trips into Concord to seek the
society of his longtime friends and to conduct what scattered business
the season demands. On one such trip, Thoreau spends a night in
jail for refusing to pay a poll tax because, he says, the government
supports slavery. Released the next day, Thoreau returns to Walden."
Walden,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/summary.html,"As he becomes acquainted with Walden Pond and neighboring ponds,
Thoreau wants to map their layout and measure their depths. Thoreau
finds that Walden Pond is no more than a hundred feet deep, thereby
refuting common folk wisdom that it is bottomless. He meditates
on the pond as a symbol of infinity that people need in their lives.
Eventually winter gives way to spring, and with a huge crash and
roar the ice of Walden Pond begins to melt and hit the shore. In
lyric imagery echoing the onset of Judgment Day, Thoreau describes
the coming of spring as a vast transformation of the face of the
world, a time when all sins are forgiven."
Walden,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/summary.html,"Walden opens with
a simple announcement that Thoreau spent two years in Walden Pond,
near Concord, Massachusetts, living a simple life supported by no
one. He says that he now resides among the civilized again; the
episode was clearly both experimental and temporary. The first chapter,
“Economy,” is a manifesto of social thought and meditations on domestic
management, and in it Thoreau sketches out his ideals as he describes
his pond project. He devotes attention to the skepticism and wonderment
with which townspeople had greeted news of his project, and he defends
himself from their views that society is the only place to live.
He recounts the circumstances of his move to Walden Pond, along
with a detailed account of the steps he took to construct his rustic
habitation and the methods by which he supported himself in the
course of his wilderness experiment. It is a chapter full of facts, figures,
and practical advice, but also offers big ideas about the claims
of individualism versus social existence, all interspersed with evidence
of scholarship and a propensity for humor."
Walden,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/summary.html,"Thoreau tells us that he completed his cabin in the spring
of 1845 and moved in on July 4 of
that year. Most of the materials and tools he used to build his
home he borrowed or scrounged from previous sites. The land he squats
on belongs to his friend Ralph Waldo Emerson; he details a cost-analysis
of the entire construction project. In order to make a little money,
Thoreau cultivates a modest bean-field, a job that tends to occupy
his mornings. He reserves his afternoons and evenings for contemplation,
reading, and walking about the countryside. Endorsing the values
of austerity, simplicity, and solitude, Thoreau consistently emphasizes
the minimalism of his lifestyle and the contentment to be derived
from it. He repeatedly contrasts his own freedom with the imprisonment
of others who devote their lives to material prosperity."
Walden,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/summary.html,"As autumn turns to winter, Thoreau begins preparations
for the arrival of the cold. He listens to the squirrel, the rabbit,
and the fox as they scuttle about gathering food. He watches the
migrating birds, and welcomes the pests that infest his cabin as
they escape the coming frosts. He prepares his walls with plaster
to shut out the wind. By day he makes a study of the snow and ice,
giving special attention to the mystic blue ice of Walden Pond,
and by night he sits and listens to the wind as it whips and whistles
outside his door. Thoreau occasionally sees ice-fishermen come to
cut out huge blocks that are shipped off to cities, and contemplates
how most of the ice will melt and flow back to Walden Pond. Occasionally
Thoreau receives a visit from a friend like William Ellery Channing
or Amos Bronson Alcott, but for the most part he is alone. In one
chapter, he conjures up visions of earlier residents of Walden Pond
long dead and largely forgotten, including poor tradesmen and former slaves.
Thoreau prefers to see himself in their company, rather than amid
the cultivated and wealthy classes."
Walden,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/summary.html,"Thoreau devotes great attention to nature, the passing
of the seasons, and the creatures with which he shares the woods.
He recounts the habits of a panoply of animals, from woodchucks
to partridges. Some he endows with a larger meaning, often spiritual
or psychological. The hooting loon that plays hide and seek with
Thoreau, for instance, becomes a symbol of the playfulness of nature
and its divine laughter at human endeavors. Another example of animal symbolism
is the full-fledged ant war that Thoreau stumbles upon, prompting
him to meditate on human warfare. Thoreau’s interest in animals
is not exactly like the naturalist’s or zoologist’s. He does not observe
and describe them neutrally and scientifically, but gives them a
moral and philosophical significance, as if each has a distinctive
lesson to teach him."
Walden,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden/summary.html,"Thoreau announces that his project at the pond is over,
and that he returned to civilized life on September 6, 1847.
The revitalization of the landscape suggests the restoration of
the full powers of the human soul, and Thoreau’s narrative observations
give way, in the last chapter of Walden, to a more
direct sermonizing about the untapped potential within humanity.
In visionary language, Thoreau exhorts us to “meet” our lives and
live fully."
Walden TwoB. F. Skinner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden2/summary.html,"In the last chapter, an epilogue, he and Frazier discuss the writing and publishing of the preceding narrative as a way of spreading the word about Walden Two."
Walden TwoB. F. Skinner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden2/summary.html,"How does Walden Two achieve this utopia? Through a science of behavior. Everything that is done at Walden Two is based on principles of behaviorism, the idea that human behavior can be controlled by manipulating contingencies of reward and, to a lesser extent, punishment. From an early age, members of Walden Two are conditioned to be productive and happy members of society. In line with its basis in science, Walden Two is an inherently experimental community. If there is evidence that a new social practice (e.g., not saying ""thank you"") will make people happier and healthier, it is immediately implemented and its consequences are carefully monitored."
Walden TwoB. F. Skinner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden2/summary.html,"Each of the visitors responds to the community differently. Castle finds it abhorrent; he spends the duration of the visit arguing with Frazier about the feasibility and desirability of a community like Walden Two. Burris, on the other hand, finds himself somewhere in the middle; he is skeptical that such a utopia could work, but he finds Frazier's arguments compelling, and he cannot discount the evidence of success in front of him. Steve and Mary are both convinced that this is the life for them; they decide to stay at Walden Two. Rodge, too, is convinced, but Barbara is not; he grudgingly leaves Walden Two with her at the end of their visit. Burris is torn, but decides to return to his academic life. However, at the train station he suddenly realizes that he would rather try life at Walden Two, for whatever it's worth, than go back to the university. He walks back to Walden Two and begins his new life there."
Walden TwoB. F. Skinner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden2/summary.html,"Rogers (""Rodge"") and Steve Jamnik, two young men returning from service at the end of WWII, stop by the office of Professor Burris to ask if he knows anything about a man named Frazier, and the new society Frazier is trying to build. Burris remembers that Frazier was a classmate of his in graduate school, one with radical ideas and a distaste for the establishment. He sends a letter to Frazier and immediately gets a reply inviting him to visit the community. Burris agrees to take time off from his academic duties to accompany Rogers and Steve on a visit to ""Walden Two,"" Frazier's community. Rodge's girlfriend Barbara, Steve's girlfriend Mary, and Burris's colleague Castle also come."
Walden TwoB. F. Skinner,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/walden2/summary.html,"Upon their arrival at Walden Two, they are greeted by Frazier. Over the course of their three-day visit, they are given a tour of Walden Two, a taste of what it is like to live and work there, and an earful of talk from Frazier about the planning that lies behind this utopian community. The population of Walden Two is about one thousand people, all of whom seem to be healthy and happy. They live in communal dwellings, eat in common dining spaces, raise their children in a communal nursery, and grow and build much of what they need. The standard workday lasts only four hours, or less; no one is paid wages--but nothing at Walden Two costs money."

When Tom returns to Red's old ranch to visit Meo, Meo shows little interest in conversation and seems to act oddly; Tom leaves promising to return shortly. During a particularly brutal ride Tom breaks his arm, and leaves the hospital to visit Meo once again. Arriving at the cabin, Tom finds Meo absent and later learns from a doctor in town that Meo has died a few weeks prior. He falls into an even deeper despair, having lost many people in his life. His riding style becomes increasingly abusive, and his social behavior increasingly reclusive. During a ride at the Garden in New York City, Tom becomes seriously injured in a fall. Nursing his injuries at the hospital, Tom receives advice from his doctor that he should never ride again, but he remains determined to return to the ring. His nurse Mary Redmond treats him with care and kindness, but he resents her efforts and believes she simply wants to control his life, as so many other individuals have tried before her. Having regained his ability to walk after significant efforts, Tom leaves the hospital with only a curt goodbye from Mary. He heads west on a train to his homeland."

Wuthering Heights,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/wuthering/summary.html,"In the late winter months of 1801, a
man named Lockwood rents a manor house called Thrushcross Grange
in the isolated moor country of England. Here, he meets his dour landlord,
Heathcliff, a wealthy man who lives in the ancient manor of Wuthering
Heights, four miles away from the Grange. In this wild, stormy countryside,
Lockwood asks his housekeeper, Nelly Dean, to tell him the story
of Heathcliff and the strange denizens of Wuthering Heights. Nelly
consents, and Lockwood writes down his recollections of her tale
in his diary; these written recollections form the main part of Wuthering
Heights."
Wuthering Heights,http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/wuthering/summary.html,"The story of Wuthering Heights is told
through flashbacks recorded in diary entries, and events are often
presented out of chronological order—Lockwood’s narrative takes
place after Nelly’s narrative, for instance, but is interspersed
with Nelly’s story in his journal. Nevertheless, the novel contains
enough clues to enable an approximate reconstruction of its chronology,
which was elaborately designed by Emily Brontë. For instance, Lockwood’s
diary entries are recorded in the late months of 1801 and
in September 1802;
in 1801, Nelly tells
Lockwood that she has lived at Thrushcross Grange for eighteen years,
since Catherine’s marriage to Edgar, which must then have occurred
in 1783. We know that
Catherine was engaged to Edgar for three years, and that Nelly was
twenty-two when they were engaged, so the engagement must have taken
place in 1780, and
Nelly must have been born in 1758.
Since Nelly is a few years older than Catherine, and since Lockwood
comments that Heathcliff is about forty years old in 1801,
it stands to reason that Heathcliff and Catherine were born around 1761,
three years after Nelly. There are several other clues like this
in the novel (such as Hareton’s birth, which occurs in June, 1778).
The following chronology is based on those clues, and should closely
approximate the timing of the novel’s important events. A “~” before
a date indicates that it cannot be precisely determined from the
evidence in the novel, but only closely estimated."
