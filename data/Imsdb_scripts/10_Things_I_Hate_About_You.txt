<b>          PADUA HIGH SCHOOL - DAY
</b>
          Welcome to Padua High School,, your typical urban-suburban 
          high school in Portland, Oregon.  Smarties, Skids, Preppies, 
          Granolas. Loners, Lovers, the In and the Out Crowd rub sleep 
          out of their eyes and head for the main building.

<b>          PADUA HIGH PARKING LOT - DAY
</b>
          KAT STRATFORD, eighteen, pretty -- but trying hard not to be 
          -- in a baggy granny dress and glasses, balances a cup of 
          coffee and a backpack as she climbs out of her battered, 
          baby blue '75 Dodge Dart.

          A stray SKATEBOARD clips her, causing her to stumble and 
          spill her coffee, as well as the contents of her backpack.

          The young RIDER dashes over to help, trembling when he sees 
          who his board has hit.

<b>                                 RIDER
</b>                    Hey -- sorry.

          Cowering in fear, he attempts to scoop up her scattered 
          belongings.

<b>                                 KAT
</b>                    Leave it 

          He persists.

                                 KAT (continuing)
                    I said, leave it!

          She grabs his skateboard and uses it to SHOVE him against a 
          car, skateboard tip to his throat.  He whimpers pitifully 
          and she lets him go.  A path clears for her as she marches 
          through a pack of fearful students and SLAMS open the door, 
          entering school.

<b>          INT. GIRLS' ROOM - DAY
</b>
          BIANCA STRATFORD, a beautiful sophomore, stands facing the 
          mirror, applying lipstick.  Her less extraordinary, but 
          still cute friend, CHASTITY stands next to her.  

<b>                                 BIANCA
</b>                    Did you change your hair?

<b>                                 CHASTITY 
</b>                    No.

<b>                                 BIANCA
</b>                    You might wanna think about it

          Leave the girls' room and enter the hallway.

<b>          HALLWAY - DAY- CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Bianca is immediately greeted by an admiring crowd, both 
          boys
          and girls alike.

<b>                                 BOY
</b>                           (adoring)
                    Hey, Bianca.

<b>                                 GIRL
</b>                    Awesome shoes.

          The greetings continue as Chastity remains wordless and 
          unaddressed by her side.  Bianca smiles proudly, 
          acknowledging her fans.

<b>          GUIDANCE COUNSELOR'S OFFICE - DAY
</b>
          CAMERON JAMES, a clean-cut, easy-going senior with an open, 
          farm-boy face, sits facing Miss Perky, an impossibly cheery 
          guidance counselor.

<b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    I'm sure you won't find Padua any 
                    different than your old school.  Same 
                    little asswipe mother-fuckers 
                    everywhere.

          Her plastic smile never leaves her face.  Cameron fidgets in 
          his chair uncomfortably.

<b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                           (continuing)
                    Any questions?

<b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    I don't think so, ma'am

<b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    Then go forth.  Scoot   I've got 
                    deviants to see.

          Cameron rises to leave and makes eye contact with PATRICK 
          VERONA, a sullen-looking bad ass senior who waits outside Ms 
          Perky's door.  His slouch and smirk let us know how cool he 
          is.

          Miss Perky looks down at her file and up at Patrick

<b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                           (continuing)
                    Patrick Verona.  I see we're making our 
                    visits a weekly ritual.

          She gives him a withering glance. He answers with a charming 
          smile.

<b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                    I missed you.

<b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    It says here you exposed yourself to a 
                    group of freshmen girls.

<b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                    It was a bratwurst.  I was eating 
                    lunch.

<b>                                 MISS PERKY
</b>                    With the teeth of your zipper?

          She motions for Patrick to enter her office and Cameron 
          shuffles out the door, bumping into MICHAEL ECKMAN, a lanky, 
          brainy senior who will either end up a politician or game 
          show host.

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    You the new guy?

<b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    So they tell me...

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    C'mon.  I'm supposed to give you the 
                    tour.

          They head out of the office

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                           (continuing)
                    So -- which Dakota you from?

<b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    North, actually.  How'd you   ?

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    I was kidding. People actually live 
                    there?

<b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    Yeah.  A couple.  We're outnumbered by 
                    the cows, though.

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    How many people were in your old 
                    school?

<b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    Thirty-two.

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    Get out!

<b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    How many people go here?

<b>                                 MICHAEL

          Prom posters adorn the wall. Michael steers Cameron through 
          the crowd as he points to various cliques.

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    We've got your basic beautiful people. 
                    Unless they talk to you first, don't 
                    bother.

          The beautiful people pass, in full jock/cheerleader 
          splendor.

                    Those 're your cowboys.

          Several Stetson-wearing, big belt buckle. Wrangler guys  
          walk by.

<b>                                 CAMERON
</b>                    That I'm used to.

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    Yeah, but these guys have never seen a 
                    horse.  They just jack off to Clint 
                    Eastwood.

          They pass an espresso cart with a group of teens huddled 
          around it.

<b>                                 MICHAEL

                    To the right, we have the Coffee Kids.  
                    Very edgy.  Don't make any sudden 
                    movements around them.

</b>                    And these delusionals are the White 
                    Rastae.

          Several white boys in dreadlocks and Jamaican knit berets 
          lounge on the grass.  A cloud of pot smoke hovers above them

<b>                                 MICHAEL

                    Big Marley fans.  Think they're black.  
                    Semi-political, but mostly, they watch a 
                    lot of Wild Kingdom, if you know what I 
                    mean.

          Michael waves to DEREK, the one with the longest dreads.

          Cameron turns to follow Michael as they walk into the 
          cafeteria.

          Loud music and loud students.  Michael sits with a group of 
          studious-looking teens.

<b>                                 MICHAEL
</b>                    Future MBAs-  We're all Ivy League,

                    sipping Merlot while those guys --

          He points to the table of jocks, as they torture various 
          passers-by.

                    back, my friend.

          He points proudly to the ALLIGATOR on his shirt.

          Cameron stops listening as BIANCA walks by, and we go SLO 
          MO.  Pure and perfect, she passes Cameron and Michael 
          without a look.

          Cameron is smitten

                    doesn't matter.  She's not allowed to 
                    date until her older sister does.  And 
                    that's an impossibility.

          A room full of bored seniors doodle and scare off into space 
          MS. BLAISE, the one-step-away-from-medication English 
          Teacher, tries to remember what she's talking about.

<b>                                 MRS. BLAISE
</b>                    Well, then.  Oh, yes.  I guess that

                    Kat?

          Kat, the girl we saw as we entered the school, slowly cakes 
          off her glasses and speaks up.

<b>                                 KAT

</b>                    This book is about a guy and his

                    Frankly, I'm baffled as to why we still 
                    revere Hemingway.  He was an abusive, 
                    alcoholic misogynist who had a lot of 
                    cats.

          JOEY DORSEY, a well-muscled jock with great cheekbones, 
          makes fun of her from his row.

<b>                                 JOEY

                    hag who has no friends?

          A few giggles.  Kat ignores him.  A practiced gesture

<b>                                 MRS. BLAISE
</b>                    That's enough, Mr. Dorsey.

                    worthy of our time

</b>                    Well, yes, compared to your other 
                    choices of expression this year, today's 
                    events are quite mild.  By the way, 
                    Bobby Rictor's gonad retrieval operation 
                    went quite well, in case you're

                    point?

          Cameron motions with his head toward Patrick, a few lab 
          tables away.  He's wearing biker glasses instead of goggles 
          as he tries to revive his frog.

</b>                    You know, if you do go out with Bianca,

          A cowboy flicks the frog's heart into one of the Coffee 
          Kid's latte.  Cameron presses on, over the melee.

          draw a penis on his cheek with the magic marker.   Michael 
          suffers the indignity and speaks undaunted.

                    this whole thing up so Cameron can get 
                    the girl.

          Patrick smiles.  He likes the idea of Joey being a pawn in 
          this game.

          Mandella winks at him and sashays inside   Kat: follows 
          behind, shaking her head.

          Patrick's mail truck clatters to a stop out front.

</b>
          Patrick walks up to Bruce, who's frisking a badly mowhawked 
          PIERCED EYEBROW BOY.  Bruce pulls a SWITCHBLADE out of the 
          boy's inside pocket.

          Bruce pushes him inside the club, then sees Patrick.

          Patrick laughs and goes into the club

<b>          INT. CLUB - NIGHT
</b>
          Onstage, the all-female band GIGGLEPUSS is parlaying their 
          bad girl sass into a ripping punk number.

          Near the stage is a joyful mass of pogo-ing teens AT THE BAR

          Patrick bellies up and looks around the club. Gigglepuss 
          finishes a song.

<b>                                 LEAD SINGER
</b>                    Hello, out there.  We're Gigglepuss and 
                    we're from Olympia.

          A teenage boy in the audience takes the opportunity to 
          scream.

<b>                                 BOY (0.S.)

<b>                                 LEAD SINGER 
</b>                    Meow

          They rev into their next song. 

<b>          NEAR THE STAGE  
</b>
          Mandella and Kat glow with sweat.  When they hear the 
          opening chords of the song, they look at each other and 
          scream with glee as they begin to dance.  They couldn't be 
          having a better time.

<b>          AT THE BAR
</b>
          Patrick signals to get the bartender's attention and looks 
          across the bouncing surge of the crowd.  He spots Kat and 
          Mandella singing along.

<b>          HIS POV
</b>
          The gleeful Kat -- dancing and looking completely at ease. 
          None of her usual "attitude".  Patrick is transfixed.  And 
          most definitely attracted.

          NEAR THE STAGE Kat looks at Mandella.

<b>                                 KAT 
</b>                           (shouting)
                    I need agua!

          She makes her way through the crowd to the bar. AT THE BAR

          She made it.  She signals for the bartender and as she's 
          waiting, looks around.  She spots Patrick a few feet away

<b>                                 KAT

                           herself) 
                    Shit

          She sneaks a glance.  He's staring, but this time he looks 
          away before she can.  Despite herself, she's miffed.

          The bartender arrives

<b>          BARTENDER 
</b>                           (shouting)

<b>                                 KAT 
</b>                    Two waters.

          She looks at Patrick again.  He's completely absorbed in the 
          band.  She scowls.  The bottled water arrives and she 
          marches off, forgetting to pay.

          She walks up to Patrick.

<b>                                 KAT

                    You're not fooling anyone.

          Patrick looks at her, surprised

                           toward the band)
                    Do you mind?  You're sort of ruining it 
                    for me.

          Kat steams.  And watches him watch the band

<b>                                 KAT 
</b>                           (yelling)
                    You're not surrounded by your usual 
                    cloud of smoke.

          The band takes a break, so they can stop yelling now

<b>                                 PATRICK 
</b>                    I know.  I quit.

          He leans back, making no attempt to hit on her.  She moves 
          closer.

<b>                                 KAT 
</b>                    Oh, really?

          He motions toward the stage

<b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                    You know, these guys are no Bikini Kill 
                    or The Raincoats, but they're right up 
                    there.

<b>                                 KAT

<b>                                 PATRICK 
</b>                    Why, don't you?

          She's completely taken aback.  He uses the moment to his 
          advantage and brushes her hair back as he speaks right into 
          her ear.

<b>                                 PATRICK 
</b>                           (continuing)
                    I watched you out there   I've never 
                    seen you look like that

          Kat steps away, brushing the hair back that he just touched 
          Her cheeks pinken.

          His cocky side is back in a flash

<b>                                 PATRICK 
</b>                           (continuing) 
                    Come to that party with me.

          At that moment, the band starts another SONG

</b>                           (yelling) 
                    What?

          The bartender approaches.

<b>          BARTENDER

                    I got it, Rick.

          He tosses some bills on the bar

          Rather than thank him, Kat simply watches him, trying to 
          figure out his motive.

<b>                                 PATRICK 
</b>                           (continuing; 
                           yelling) 
                    Nine-thirty then.

          A few people have gotten between them at the bar and she 
          can't hear a word he's saying.  She gives him one last look 
          and heads back into the crowd.

          Patrick smiles.  She didn't say no this time.

<b>          EXT. CLUB SKUNK - NIGHT

          The crowd files out of the club, Kat and Mandella amongst 
          them.  A^ they're walking toward the parking lot, Patrick 
          coasts by in his truck.  The gears GRIND.  He yells out the 
          window.

<b>                                 MANDELLA

<b>                                 MANDELLA
</b>                    Has he importun'd you with love in 
                    honourable fashion?

          Kat glances sharply at her.

<b>                                 MANDELLA 
</b>                           (continuing; off 
                           her look)
                    Don't be Cruella with me.  I'm in favor 
                    of romance.  You're the one that wants 
                    to march on Washington every five 
                    minutes.

          Kat pokes her, then looks back at the club dreamily.

<b>                                 KAT

          Kat links her arm through Mandella's and they head for the 
          car.

                    didn't wear the Kenneth Coles with that

          Walter emerges from the kitchen with a mile-high sandwich 
          The girls are like statues.  Walter jumps.

<b>                                 BIANCA

</b>                    If you must know, we were attempting to 
                    go to a small study group of friends.

<b>                                 WALTER

</b>                    It's just a party. Daddy, but I knew 
                    you'd forbid me to go since "Gloria 
                    Steinem" over there isn't going --

          She points to Kat -- Walkman blaring -- who comes 
          downstairs, wearing a baby tee and battered Levis.  Her 
          relaxing-at-home look is about 400 times sexier than her at-
          school look.  She wanders toward the kitchen.

          Walter directs his attention toward Kat.

<b>                                 WALTER
</b>                    Do you know about any party? Katarina?

          Kat shrugs as she comes back out of the kitchen with an 
          apple

<b>                                 BIANCA

                    you're too busy listening to Bitches Who

          Bianca and Chastity look at each other, thrilled, and burst 
          into gleeful screams.

          A startled Walter clutches Bianca in a protective hug.

          Kat stomps to the door, grabbing her car keys off the hall

          Kat enters, then quickly tries to make an about face.  Joey 
          sees her and rushes over to block her, standing in the

                    for an ad for Queen Harry next week.

          Bianca tries to appear impressed, but it's getting 
          difficult.

          A very drunken Kat jumps up onto the kitchen island and 
          starts dancing by herself.  She lets loose, hair flying. 
          She's almost burlesque.

          Others form a crowd, clapping and cheering her on

          She swings her head around BANGING it on a copper pot 
          hanging from the rack above the center island.  She starts 
          to sway, then goes down as Patrick rushes over to catch her.

          The others CLAP, thinking this is a wonderful finale. 
          Patrick sets her down on her feet, holding her up

          Patrick drives as Kat sits in the passenger seat, fiddling 
          with the radio dial.  She finds a SONG she's happy with and 
          Patrick quickly changes it.

          He turns to look at her -- she looks anything but scary 
          right now.  He tries to hide his smile.

          They eye each other, sharing a moment of connection, 
          realizing they're both created the same exterior for 
          themselves.

          Patrick pulls into her driveway and shuts off the motor.  He 
          looks up at her house.

          She looks at him for a moment -- then grabs his face and

          From outside, we hear the soft, unsure beginnings of a SONG. 
          Kat looks up, then out the window, HORRIFIED.

          The song grows louder until we realize it's The Partridge 
          Family's "I Think I Love You".  Being sung by Patrick.

          The STUDENTS rush to the window. OUTSIDE Patrick stands 
          beneath the window, crooning.

          Scurvy is next to him, keeping the beat on the bongos and 
          doing backup vocal s.

          He makes the appropriate hand gesture

          Mr. Chapin, the gym teacher, sits at the desk in front, 
          ignoring them while he reads a girly weightlifting magazine

<b>                                 KAT (0. S.)

          Patrick looks up at the sound of her voice and sees Kat 
          standing in the doorway.  She gives him a smile and he perks 
          up a little.

          Kat walks into the room and addresses Mr. Chapin again. He 
          turns fully to face her.

<b>                                 KAT

                    that Mr. Verona ' s current 
                    incarceration is unnecessary.  I never 
                    filed a complaint.

</b>                    You didn't have to.  He disrupted a 
                    classroom.

          Kat glances over at Patrick and motions her head toward the 
          window.

          Patrick shrugs, not knowing what she ' s talking about.

          She motions again, and looks toward the window with an 
          expression that says, "Make a break for it, moron."

          Kat brings her attention back to Mr. Chapin while Patrick 
          inches out of his seat toward the window.

          The other miscreants watch with glee.

<b>                                 KAT
</b>                    But, Mr. Chapin, I hardly think a 
                    simple serenade warrants a week of 
                    detention.  There are far more hideous 
                    acts than off-key singing being 
                    performed by the student body on a 
                    regular basis.

          Patrick is halfway out the window now.  And none too happy 
          about it, considering they're on the second floor.

          He eyes a large TREE a few feet away from MR. CHAPIN.  He 
          starts to turn away from Kat

                    Rules stick.

          the tree.

</b>                    Wait, Mr. Chapin.  There's something 
                    I've always wanted to show you.

          He turns back toward her again, the very second before he 
          would have spotted Patrick.

          Kat glances toward the window.  Patrick's just about to make 
          the jump.

<b>                                 MR. CHAPIN

          From behind, we see her lift up her shirt and flash her bra 
          at Mr. Chapin, just as Patrick makes the Jump.

          The miscreants cheer, for both the daring' escape and the 
          flash of skin.

          Patrick nails Kat in the back with a big glob of red paint 
          Kat gets him in the chest with a glob of blue.

          Patrick returns fire with a big yellow splat to the side of

          Kat squirts a green shot to his forehead After a few more 
          shots, they're both covered in paint

          She tries to shoot him again, only to find that her gun is 
          empty.

          Patrick grabs her in a victorious tackle.  They land, 
          laughing.

          It's hard to even recognize them, as their hair and faces 
          are so smeared with paint globs, but they still manage to 
          find each other's eyes.

          He wipes a smear of blue paint away from her lips,  as he

          whispering into her ear is making her laugh.

          He grabs her and kisses her to shut her up.  After a second, 
          she jerks away and flees down the stairs and out of sight.

          Bianca stands at the top of the stairs, watching.  She's

          leans across the birthday cake to get a kiss from her dream 
          date, Kat changes the channel disgustedly, settling for an 
          infomercial

          Bianca gives her a squeeze, then jumps up when the DOORBELL 
          rings, opening the door to a waiting Cameron.  He peeks his

                    I wanted her to get a boyfriend so I 
                    could.  Apparently, this makes me a 
                    horrible person.  I'm sorry.

          She turns to Kat.

                    involved.  I would never intentionally

          Kat stands, puts on her glasses, and takes a deep breath 
          before reading from her notebook.

          stares at the floor.

          She looks directly at Patrick.  He looks back this time.  
          The look they exchange says everything.

          Then she walks out of the room The rest of the class remains 
          in stunned silence.

          Kat walks to her car alone. When she opens the door, she's 
          greeted with a Fender Stratocaster guitar, reclining in the 
          front seat.

          She picks it up slowly, inspecting every detail, then spins 
          around.

          Patrick stands there, smiling.

          She doesn't answer, but hides a smile, so he walks  closer.
