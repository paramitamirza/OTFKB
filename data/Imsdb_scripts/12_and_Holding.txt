<b>          FADE IN:
</b>
<b>          EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - MORNING
</b>
          TWIN BOYS, RUDY AND JACOB CARGES (12), ride their bikes
          through a suburban neighborhood.

          Rudy, the more athletic of the two, rides at a breakneck
          pace. Jacob rides slowly due to a HOCKEY MASK that he wears
          over his face. It's making it difficult for him to see. The
          boys turn down a DIRT PATH and ride deep into some WOODS.

<b>          INT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Rudy and Jacob ride to the edge of a CLEARING and stop.
          Across from the clearing is a large OAK TREE, which has a
          TREE HOUSE perched high up in it's branches. The boys
          cautiously look around and whisper.

<b>                               JACOB
</b>                     You see `em?

<b>                               RUDY
</b>                     No. But that doesn't mean they're
                     not here.

          After a beat, Rudy gets off his bike and starts walking
          towards the tree house.   Jacob stays behind, eyeing their
          safety.

                               RUDY (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                     Jacob, come on. It's cool.

          Suddenly, a ROCK comes careening from off screen.   It hits
          Jacob in the head and knocks him to the ground.

          Rudy darts for the oak tree as a hail storm of rock and
          debris come flying at him.

          As Jacob rises, a stream of blood pours down the front of his
          mask. He quickly runs for the tree.

          TWO BOYS, JEFF AND KENNY (14), trailer park, punks come
          running out of the woods, rocks in hand.

          Rudy and Jacob climb the tree, using makeshift RUNGS that are
          nailed into the trunk. In the floor of the tree house is a
          DOOR. Rudy removes a KEY from a chain around his neck and
          unlocks it. He climbs inside and pulls Jacob in after him.

</b>
          Jacob looks back and sees Jeff and Kenny, running over. Rudy
          crosses to the door with a BUCKET of liquid.

<b>                              JACOB
</b>                    What the hell is that?

<b>                              RUDY
</b>                    Piss.

          Rudy dumps the piss onto Jeff and Kenny.

<b>          EXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME
</b>
          Now drenched with piss, Jeff and Kenny jump from the tree,
          screaming. They try to shake the urine off.

          Kenny spits the taste out of his mouth and angrily calls up
          to the boys.

<b>                              KENNY
</b>                    You and your deformed brother are
                    dead!

<b>          INT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME
</b>
          Jacob rips the hockey mask off. (A large STRAWBERRY
          BIRTHMARK covers the right side of his face.) He's insulted.

<b>                              RUDY

<b>          EXT. TREE HOUSE - SAME TIME

          Jeff and Kenny walk off.

<b>                              KENNY
</b>                    They're fucking dead!

          Jeff runs off screen and throws up.

          LEONARD FISHER (12), severely obese, sits at the dinner
          table, eating pancakes.

          His FATHER, PATRICK (35) and TWO YOUNGER SISTERS, HALEY (8)
          and SARA (6) are seated with him. They are all overweight.

          LEONARD'S MOTHER, GRACE (35), the largest of them all,
          crosses to the table, sits and starts eating.

          JUMP CUTS show the progression of their meal. From globs of
          syrup being placed over pancakes to the mass consumption of
          omelets and sausage. Caught up with eating, nobody speaks.

          YACCO CHUANG (35), Asian-American, sexy, uptight,
          psychiatrist, paces the hallway on the phone.

          HER DAUGHTER, MALEE (12) with long, black, braided hair and
          thick rimmed glasses, peeks her head out of the bathroom.

<b>                                 MALEE

          Yacco walks off.    Deflated, Malee reenters the bathroom.

<b>          INT. CHUNG HOME - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS
</b>
          Malee is wrapped in a towel and holding a TAMPON. Confused,
          she grabs the TAMPON BOX and reads the directions. Malee's
          confusion quickly turns to disgust.

          Leonard sits upon a large rock with the words, LINDSAY ACRES
          inscribed on the center of it. He eats POPCORN. Hanging off
          the top right hand corner of the rock is a banner, which
          reads, 5th ANNUAL 4TH OF JULY PICNIC. ALL INVITED.

          Malee rides her bike up to Leonard. She HONKS her BIKE HORN
          at every pedestrian in her path.

                           (off his disgusted look)
                       What? It's a natural process. You

          Jacob wipes at his head wound, frightened.

                       on, you'd have seen it coming. Our

                       back up, decapitate his victim and

          Yacco sits across from DEBBIE POOLE (42), housewife,

          Hurt, Leonard looks down at his own plate, which overflows
          with food. He feels embarrassed and disgusted.

          Rudy struggles to get free, but he's overpowered. A crowd of
          kids surround them, chanting, "FIGHT, FIGHT".

<b>                                 DOCTOR
</b>                       Leonard has a condition.    It's
                       called Anosmia.

<b>                                    GRACE
</b>                       Oh my God!     Is it serious?

<b>                                 DOCTOR
</b>                       No. Anosmia is when a person
                       looses their sense of smell. It's
                       not uncommon in patients who suffer
                       serious head injuries.
                       Unfortunately, it's also affecting
                       his ability to taste. Again, not
                       uncommon.

<b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                       Is it permanent?

<b>                                 DOCTOR
</b>                       Depends on the patient.

<b>                                 GRACE
</b>                       What do we do? He can't eat.

<b>                                 DOCTOR
</b>                       He can eat. He just can't taste
                       what he's eating.

<b>                                 PATRICK
</b>                       What she means is, he won't eat.

<b>                                 DOCTOR
</b>                       Leonard's association with food is
                       no longer about taste. It's about
                       texture. While we may be partial
                       to sweet or salty foods, Leonard
                       will become partial to crunchy or
                       smooth ones. Once he settles on a
                       texture he likes, his appetite will
                       increase.

<b>                                 GRACE
</b>                       I can't believe this is happening.

<b>                                 DOCTOR
</b>                       Considering what Leonard could have
                       suffered, he's lucky. Besides, he
                       is severely overweight. A loss of
                       appetite may be a benefit.

          Grace and Patrick shoot him a look of death.





<b>          INT. LEONARD'S HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME TIME
</b>
          Leonard lies in bed, staring out the window. A NURSE (40)
          enters and crosses over to his bedside table.

<b>                              NURSE
</b>                    How'd we do?

          The nurse sees that Leonard has barely touched his food.

                              NURSE (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    You have to eat something. It may
                    not be gourmet, but you don't look
                    that finicky.

<b>                              LEONARD
</b>                    This stuff feels like shit in my
                    mouth.

<b>                              NURSE
</b>                    It's macaroni and cheese.

<b>                              LEONARD
</b>                    It feels gross. Like there's a
                    film on my tongue.

          The nurse grabs the tray of food. She removes an untouched
          apple and places it in Leonard's hand.

                              LEONARD (CONT'D) (cont'd)
                    I don't like apples.

<b>                              NURSE
</b>                    So, you can't taste it, right?
                    Maybe you'll like the crunch.

          The nurse exits. Leonard eyes the apple in his hand. A
          beat. He reluctantly takes a bite. The apple makes a loud
          CRUNCH. Leonard starts chewing. After a few seconds, a
          smile comes to his face. He likes it.

          Jacob lies in bed, holding Rudy's old baseball GLOVE. He
          brings the glove to his nose, and a flood of old memories
          come back to him.

          Jacob rises, crosses over to the closet and removes a metal
          LOCK BOX. He selects 666 for the combination and the box
          opens. Jacob removes the contents; baseball cards, some
          firecrackers, a few ticket stubs and a PHOTOGRAPH of he and
          Rudy at age 5. He can't help but smile.

          COACH GILMORE (55), overweight, gym teacher, dressed in a
          jogging suit, snaps gum while addressing his students.

          The class of boys stand up against the wall.    Leonard is
          amongst them. His gym uniform barely fits.

                    I'm sure you all remember it from
                    last year. I will be testing you
                    in a number of physical fitness
                    areas.

          As coach speaks, Leonard looks as if he's going to throw up.

                    body strength is ten chin ups.

          The student finishes his run with a count of twelve.   He hops
          off the bar and crosses over to his classmates.

                    Leonard, you're up.

          Leonard crosses to the chin-up bar, grabs a hold of it and
          begins struggling to lift himself up. Unfortunately, he can
          only manage 1/8th of an inch. Leonard drops off the bar,
          exhausted.

                              COACH (CONT'D) (cont'd)

          The student rises off the mat and walks over to the other
          boys. Leonard enters frame and drops on the mat like a ton
          of bricks.

          Leonard's face turns red. He clenches his teeth.
          Unfortunately, due to the pressure he is exerting, he blows a
          loud fart. The gym erupts with laughter.

          heavy.

          removes 2 books and hands them to Leonard.

          MALEE in the flute section, playing her heart out.

          The CONDUCTOR, MR. FARMER (40) overly energetic and dorky,
          waves his baton, silencing the band.

          Malee stands outside Mr. Farmer's office, staring at the SIGN
          UP SHEET on his door. After a beat, she lifts her pen to
          sign her name. Before she writes it, she stops, quickly
          turns around and walks away.

          After a beat, Malee returns to the sign up sheet and starts
          writing her name. Halfway through, she stops, scratches out
          her name and walks off.

          We remain on the sign up sheet. After a few seconds, Malee's
          hand enters the shot and writes in her name.

                       so horrific, our memory blocks it
                       out. That way we won't have to
                       relive the pain. It's called
                       repression. Our bodies are not so
                       forgiving, however. Inside, we
                       feel the effects of trauma even

                       I went to work today. For the
                       first time in weeks. It was as if
                       I had just gotten out of college!
                       I was fearless! I went after
                       accounts I had avoided for years
                       because I thought they were out of
                       my league. I spoke to presidents,
                       vice presidents, business managers,
                       sales reps. I was amazing. I was

                       share the news with your mother, I
                       discovered her asleep. When I
                       looked around the house, I realized
                       that her "office", for lack of a
                       better word, was also piled up.
                       So, I took to the house. I have
                       made it my duty to clean this place
                       from top to bottom. Even if it

<b>          INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - CONTINUOUS

          A packed audience listens to A GIRL (12), standing center
          stage and singing "The Rose". She is not nearly as good as
          she thinks she is, but she sings full throttle.

          We FIND Malee, sitting in the flute section and playing along
          with the rest of the orchestra. She looks to the front row,
          but Gus is no where to be found.

          The girl finishes her song, and the crowd politely applauds.

          Mr. Farmer crosses to the microphone.

<b>                              MR. FARMER

                    impressed with that rendition.

          The crowd laughs.   Mr. Farmer didn't mean for it to be a
          joke.

                    Chung. She will play the theme
                    from "Love Story" on the flute.

          The crowd applauds as Malee rises and crosses to the
          microphone.

<b>                              MALEE

          the front row and sits. Malee lights up.

          At the mention of The Doors, Gus' smile instantly fades.    The
          coincidence is just too great.

          Malee starts to play "Light My Fire". She is good. Mr.

          Gus gives Malee an innocent kiss on the check and then walks

          flute in ecstacy.

          his old, weaker self. Stronger, he makes a few more yards
          and then is forced to stop.

          Obviously drunk, Gus stumbles to his front door.   He fumbles
          for his keys and enters.





<b>          INT. GUS'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER
</b>
          Gus lies in bed with a bottle of whiskey in one hand and a
          GUN in the other. Distraught and at the point of tears, Gus
          opens the chamber and loads the gun with a single bullet.

          Then he spins the chamber and locks it. Gus puts the gun to
          his head and fires. NOTHING. He throws the gun across the
          room, grabs the bottle of whiskey and drinks it till it's
          gone.

          Ashley stands with a big smile on her face.

                    cell last night. Sally Yngve
                    called just now to tell me.

          Jim and Jacob sit, stunned. Their shock turns to intrigue as
          Ashley, appearing unaffected by the news, crosses to the
          kitchen table, opens a nearby box of donuts and begins
          eating. She is smiling.

<b>                              JACOB

                    story.

          Ashley crosses to the kitchen sink. She rolls up her sleeves
          and begins cleaning. Jim crosses over to her and they kiss
          as if nothing happened. Jacob is baffled by their behavior.

          Jim sits on the couch, drifting in and out of sleep.

          Ashley, dressed in her finest Christmas sweater, peruses the

          She is a drastically different woman than the last time we

          Malee cautiously enters, shutting the door behind her. A
          beat. She allows the excitement to settle in. It's your
          typical bachelor pad. Stray beer bottles decorate every
          shelf and end table. Dirty clothes drape across an old

          dressed in a firefighter's uniform. He appears much younger
          and clean cut.

          As Malee returns the album to the night stand, she notices a

          Gus removes a beer from the fridge. We follow him into his
          bedroom. He stops cold as if feeling the presence of some
          one else there, but Malee is nowhere to be found.

          Gus begins getting undressed. We follow his shirt to the
          floor and SEE Malee, hiding underneath his bed.

          Malee looks out from underneath the bed. She watches as the
          now naked Gus enters the shower stall in the bathroom.

          As the water falls upon Gus, Malee rises from underneath the

          Grace begins walking downstairs. Due to her size, she has
          difficultly maneuvering through the tight space. Her
          inability to see her feet isn't helping matters.

          Grace makes it downstairs, but Leonard is nowhere in sight.

          places the food onto plates.

          The table is set to the nines. A small candle burns in the

          pregnant beat. It's a tense moment, and we are unsure of
          what he's going to do. Then Gus moves past her and crosses

          Jacob gets off of Keith and crosses to his closet. He pulls
          out the lock box, unlocks it and removes the gun. He points
          it at Keith.

                    You do the best you can as a

                    what's right. But you're my son.
                    I'd do anything for you. I'd fight
                    for you, I'd kill for you, I'd die

          almost calculating look in his eyes.

                       had to cremate her body because

                       enough for her to fit in. Even if

                       You just have to run to the end of

          Jacob lies awake, staring out the window.     A heavy wind
          blows.

<b>          SFX: WATCH ALARM
</b>
          Jacob sits up and silences his watch alarm.

          Keith awakens as well, but remains silent. He watches as
          Jacob grabs a bag and exits the house through the window.

          Once he's gone, Keith gets off the top bunk, crosses to the
          window and watches as Jacob runs off.

          Immediately, Keith crosses to the closet. He removes the
          lock box and begins trying combinations to open it.

<b>          EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - SHORT TIME LATER

          A heavy rain begins to fall as Jacob rides up. He sees
          Kenny, standing inside of a partially, constructed house.

<b>                              KENNY
</b>                    Put this on.

          Jacob removes his backpack and puts on the poncho. Then he
          opens his backpack and removes his HOCKEY MASK. (The same
          mask he was wearing at the beginning of the movie.)

                              KENNY (CONT'D) (cont'd)

          Kenny files in behind Jacob, and the boys make their way deep

          Keith has forgone opening the lock box via a combination and
          now tries to pry the top open with a SCREWDRIVER. He works
          frantically, fearing Jacob's return.

          Jacob and Henry make their way to the edge of the

<b>          INT. JACOB'S HOME - BEDROOM - SAME TIME

          Jacob rises, holding the gun.   He points it at Kenny.

                    What the fuck?

          Jacob shakes, frightened and reluctant to do what he believes
          he has to do.

<b>                              JACOB

                    I won't go. I'll stay here. I'll
                    do my probation.

          Jacob cocks the gun.   Tears stream down his checks.

<b>                              JACOB

          Jacob fires. Kenny is hit in the head.      He drops to the
          ground instantly.

          The force of the gun, knocks Jacob to the ground.      As he
          falls, the hockey mask comes down over his face.

          Jacob sits for a beat, staring at Kenny's lifeless body.
          Lightning flashes, illuminating his blue eyes through the
          hockey mask.

          Jacob climbs through his window, soaking wet. He crosses to
          his closet and begins to change. Keith lies in bed, watching.

          Jacob removes the gun from his pocket and places it back
          inside the lock box. His hands shake violently. As he puts
          the box back inside the closet. He finds Rudy's glove. He
          smells the leather and smiles.

          Jacob takes the glove and crosses over to his bed.    He places
          the glove beside Keith.
